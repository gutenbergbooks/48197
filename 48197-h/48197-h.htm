<h3>VERNON'S.</h3>


<p>The Banking House of the Vernons was known
through all the Home Counties as only second to
the Bank of England in stability and strength.
That is to say, the people who knew about such
matters, the business people, the professional classes,
and those who considered themselves to be acquainted
with the world, allowed that it ought to
be considered second: but this opinion was not
shared by the greater proportion of its clients, the
shopkeepers in Redborough and the adjacent towns,
the farmers of a wide district, and all the smaller
people whose many united littles make up so much
wealth. To them Vernon's bank was the emblem of
stability, the impersonation of solid and substantial
wealth. It had risen to its height of fame under
John Vernon, the grandfather of the present head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the firm, though it had existed for two or three
generations before him. But John Vernon was one
of those men in whose hands everything turns to
gold. What the special gift is which determines
this it is difficult to tell, but there can be little
doubt that it is a special gift, just as it is a
particular genius which produces a fine picture or
a fine poem. There were wiser men than he, and
there were men as steady to their work and as
constantly in their place, ready for all the claims of
business, but not one other in whose hands everything
prospered in the same superlative way. His
investments always answered, his ships always came
home, and under his influence the very cellars of the
banking-house, according to the popular imagination,
filled with gold. At one period of his career a panic
seized the entire district, and there was a run upon
the bank, by which it was evident anybody else
must, nay, ought, to have been ruined; but John
Vernon was not ruined. It was understood afterwards
that he himself allowed that he did not
understand how he had escaped, and nobody else
could understand it: but he did escape, and as a
natural consequence became stronger and richer,
and more universally credited than ever. His son
after him had not the same genius for money, but
at least he had the genius for keeping what he had
got, which is next best.</p>

<p>Edward Vernon, however, was not so fortunate in
his family as in his affairs. He had two sons, one of
whom died young, leaving a little daughter to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
brought up by her grandfather; the other "went
wrong." Oh, never-ending family tragedy, never
ending, still beginning, the darkest anguish that
exists in the world! The younger son went wrong,
and died also in his father's lifetime, leaving a
helpless little family of children, and a poor wife
stupefied with trouble. She did her best, poor soul,
to bring up her boy to ways the very opposite of
those in which his father had stumbled and fallen,
and it was supposed that he would marry his cousin
Catherine Vernon, and thus unite once more all the
money and prestige of the house. He too was John
Vernon, and resembled the golden great-grandfather,
and great things were hoped of him. He entered
the bank in old Mr. Vernon's time, and gave every
promise of being a worthy successor as long as the
senior partner, the head of the house, lived. But
when the old gentleman died and John Vernon
became in his turn the head of the house, there
very soon appeared signs of change. In the first
place the marriage with his cousin never came to
pass; things had seemed to promise fairly so long as
the grandfather with whom she lived was alive. But
after, there was an immediate cooling of sentiment.
Whose fault this was nobody knew. She said
nothing on the subject even to her dearest friends;
nor did he say anything; but he laughed and waved
aside all questions as a man who "could an if he
would"&mdash;&mdash;. His mother, for her part, said a great
deal. She ran between them like an excited hen,
shaking her tail-feathers and cackling violently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
What did they mean by it? What was it for?
She asked her son how he could forget that if
Catherine's money went out of the business it would
make the most extraordinary difference? and she
bade Catherine remember that it would be almost
dishonest to enrich another family with money
which the Vernons had toiled for. Catherine, who
was not by any means an ordinary girl, smiled upon
her, perhaps a little sadly, and entered into no explanations.
But her son, as was natural, scoffed at
his mother. "What should you know about the
business?" he said. Poor Mrs. Vernon thought she
had heard enough of it to understand it, or at least
to understand the intentions of those who understood
it. But what is the use of a mother's remonstrances?
The new generation will please itself and take its
way. She scolded and wept for years after, poor
soul, in vain, and yet could never learn that it was
in vain, but began anew day after day weeping,
entreating, remonstrating, falling into nervous crises
of passion a hundred and a hundred times over.
How much better for her to have held her tongue!
but how could she help it? She was not of that
placid and patient nature which can be wise. And
gradually things began to go badly with John. He
married a young lady belonging to a county family,
but with no money to keep up her pretensions. He
had his stables full of horses and his house full of
company. "What is it all to come to?" cried his
poor, anxious, angry, disappointed, despairing mother,
seeking opportunities to have a few words with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
to speak to him seriously, to remind him of his duty.
To be sure she did a great deal more harm than
good. She drew many a blow upon herself which
she might have escaped had she been content to
allow that his life had passed far beyond her guidance;
but the poor lady would not be taught. And
it was quite true what John Vernon said. It would
take a long time, he told her, before a few horses
and pleasant company would affect Vernon's bank.
As the head of that establishment he was expected
to be hospitable, and keep almost open house; the
country which trusted in him knew he could afford
it. The Redborough people went further, and liked
to see the confidence with which he spent his money.
What could that do to Vernon's? He had never
lived up to his income yet, he believed. So he told
his mother, who was never satisfied, and went on till
the day of her death always seeking a few words
with him&mdash;an opportunity of speaking seriously to
her son. Poor mother! nothing went very well
with her; perhaps she was not clever either at
managing her children or her money. The partisans
of the Vernons said so at least; they said so of all
the wives that were not Vernons, but interlopers,
always working harm. They said so also of Mrs.
John, and there his mother thought they were not
far wrong. But none of her children turned out
very satisfactorily; the girls married badly; Edward,
her younger son, went into the Church, and never
was more than a vicar, and their money matters
would not go right. Certainly she was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
fortunate woman. But she died, happily for her,
before anything material happened to realise her
alarms in respect to John.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how money grows when it is in
the way of growing&mdash;when it has got the genuine
impulse and rolls every kindred atom near it, according
to some occult law of attraction, into itself.
But just as wonderfully as money grows does it melt
away when the other&mdash;the contrary process&mdash;has
begun. John Vernon was quite right in saying that
the bank justified, nay, almost demanded, a certain
amount of expenditure from its chief partner. And
he was more, much more, than its chief partner.
Catherine, though she was as deeply interested in
it as himself, took no responsibility whatever&mdash;how
should she, a girl who knew as much about money
as her pony did? She took less interest, indeed,
than in ordinary circumstances she would have done,
for there was certainly something, whatever it might
be, which had interrupted the natural intercourse
between the two cousins. They were not at ease
with each other like brother and sister, as everything
suggested they ought to have been&mdash;not sufficiently
at ease to consider their mutual interests together,
as partners ought to have done. This, one of them
at least thought, would have been ridiculous in any
case. When his lawyers asked what Catherine
thought on this or that subject, he laughed in
their faces.</p>

<p>"What should she think? What should she
know? Of course she leaves all that to me,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
he said. "How can a girl understand banking
business?"</p>

<p>But this did not satisfy the respectable firm of
solicitors who advised the banker.</p>

<p>"Miss Vernon is not a girl any longer," said Mr.
Pounce, who was its head; upon which John Vernon
laughed, one of those offensive laughs with which a
coarse-minded man waves the banner of his sex
over an unmarried woman.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "Catherine's growing an old maid.
She must look alive if she means to get a husband."</p>

<p>Mr. Pounce was not a sentimentalist, and no doubt
laughed sometimes too at the unfortunate women
who had thus failed in the object of their life; but
he respected Miss Vernon, and he was very doubtful
of her cousin.</p>

<p>"Husband or no husband, I think she ought to be
consulted," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I will take Catherine in my own hands,"
was the cousin's reply.</p>

<p>And thus life went on, very gay, fast, amusing,
and expensive on one side; very quiet and uneventful
on the other. John Vernon built himself a grand
new house, in which there were all the latest improvements
and scientific luxuries, which the most
expensive upholsterers filled with the most costly
furniture, and for which the skilfullest gardeners all
but created ready-made trees and shrubberies. He
filled it with fine company&mdash;names which the clerks
at the bank felt were a credit to the establishment,
and which the townsfolk looked upon with admiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
awe: and there was nothing in the county to equal
Mrs. John Vernon's dresses and diamonds. What
is all that to a great bank, gathering money every
hour?&mdash;nothing! Even Mr. Pounce acknowledged
this. Personal extravagance, as long as it is merely
hospitality and show, must go a very long way
indeed before it touches the great revenue of such
a business. It was not the diamonds nor the feasts
that they were afraid of. But to be lavish with
money is a dangerous fault with a man who is a
business man. It is a very common sin, but there
is nothing more perilous. In Manchester or Liverpool,
where they turn over a fortune every day,
perhaps this large habit of sowing money about
does not matter. People there are accustomed to
going up and down. Bankruptcy, even, does not
mean the end of the world in these regions. But a
banker in a country town, who has all the money of
a district in his hands, should not get into this
reckless way. His clients are pleased&mdash;up to a
certain limit. But when once the first whisper of
suspicion has been roused it flies fast, and the panic
with which rural depositors rush upon a bank which
has awakened the ghost of an apprehension, is even
more cruel and unreflecting than other panics. It
went on a long time, and where it was that the first
suggestion came from, nobody ever knew. Probably
it did not come from any one&mdash;it was in the air, it
struck two people, all at once, talking to each other,
and the electricity of the contact found a single
syllable of utterance. When that was done, all was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
done. Everybody had been waiting for this involuntary
signal; and when it came, it flew like lightning
through all Redborough, and out into the roads and
lanes&mdash;to distant farmhouses, into the rectories and
vicarages, even to the labourer's cottage. "It's said
as Vernon's bank's a-going to break," the ploughmen
in the fields said to each other. It did not matter
much to them; and perhaps they were not sorry that
the farmer, who grew fat (they thought) on their
toil, should feel that he was also human. The
farmers had something of the same feeling in respect
to their landlords, but could not indulge it for the
furious terror that took possession of themselves.
Vernon's bank! Safer than the Bank of England,
was what they had all said exultingly. Very few of
them had sufficient command of themselves to wait
now and inquire into it and see how far the panic
was well founded. To wait would have been to
leave the chance of salvation to other men.</p>

<p>Mrs. John Vernon was considered very refined and
elegant according to the language of the day, a young
lady with many accomplishments. But it was the
fashion of the time to be unpractical just as it is the
fashion of our time that women should understand
business and be ready for any emergency. To wear
your hair in a high loose knot on the top of your
head, with ringlets straying down your cheek, and
across the always uncovered whiteness of your
shoulders, and to sing the songs of Mr. Haynes
Bayley, "Oh no, we never mention her," or "The
Soldier's Tear"&mdash;could anything be more entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
inconsistent with business habits? Mrs. John would
have considered it a slight to the delicacy of her
mind to have been supposed to know anything
about the bank; and when the head clerk demanded
an audience at an unseasonable hour one summer
evening she was entirely taken aback.</p>

<p>"Me! do you mean that it is me Mr. Rule
wants to see?" she asked of the servant in consternation.</p>

<p>"He did ask for master, ma'am," said the man,
"but as master's from home he said he must see
my lady. He looks very flustered. I'll say that for
him," he added.</p>

<p>To be sure William had heard the whisper in
the air, and was more or less gratified that Mr.
Rule should be flustered; but as for his lady, she
saw no connection whatever between Mr. Rule's
excitement and herself.</p>

<p>"I do not see what good I can do him, William;
and it's not an hour at which I ever receive people.
I am sure I don't know what he can want with me."</p>

<p>"It's business, I think, ma'am," said the servant,
with a little eagerness. He wanted immensely
himself to know what it was, and it did not occur
to him as possible that his mistress, so much more
interested than he, should be without anxiety or
concern.</p>

<p>"Business!" said Mrs. John, "what do I
know about business? However," she added, "if
he is so desirous, perhaps you had better show him
up. Your master is always pleased when I pay a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
little attention to the clerks. He says it does
good."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said William.</p>

<p>Being a reasonable human creature he was
touched in spite of himself by the extraordinary
sight of this poor, fine lady, sitting in her short
sleeves on the edge of the volcano, and knowing
nothing about it. It was too bad of master, William
thought, if so be&mdash;&mdash; To leave the poor lady
entirely in the dark so that she did not know no
more than a baby what the clerk could want with
her. William speculated, too, on his own circumstances
as he went down stairs. If so be&mdash;&mdash; It
was a good place, and he would be sorry to lose it.
But he remembered that somebody had said the
Sandersons were looking out for a butler.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vernon will see you, sir," he said in the
midst of these thoughts; and Mr. Rule followed him
eagerly up stairs.</p>

<p>But what could Mrs. John do? Her dress was
spotted muslin, as most dresses were in those days;
it was cut rather low on the shoulders, though she
was not dressed for company. She had pretty little
ringlets falling upon her cheeks, and short sleeves,
and a band round her waist with a shining clasp.
She was considered brilliant in conversation, and
sang, "We met, 'twas in a crowd," and the songs
previously mentioned, with so much feeling that
people had been known to weep as they listened.
The clerk had heard of all these accomplishments,
and as he hurried in, his eye was caught by the harp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in its corner, which was also one of the fashions of
the time. He could not help being a little overawed
by it, notwithstanding his dreadful anxiety.
Poor lady! the thought passed through his mind as
similar thoughts had passed through William's&mdash;Would
all this be sold away from her? White
muslin dresses with low necks have the advantage
that they quite seem to separate their wearers from
everyday life. We have no doubt that the dying
out of chivalry, and the way in which women nowadays
insist on doing their own business, and most
likely other people's too, is in great part to be put
down to high dresses and long sleeves. In these
habiliments a lady looks not so very much different
from other people. She feels herself free to go into
common life. But Mrs. John sat there helpless,
ignorant, quite composed and easy in her mind, with
pretty feet in sandalled slippers peeping from under
her dress. Mr. Rule had time for all this distressed,
regretful sympathy before he could stammer out in
a hurry his anxious question&mdash;or rather his hope&mdash;that
Mr. Vernon would be home to-morrow&mdash;early?</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know," said Mrs. John. "It
would be scarcely worth his while to go away if he
was to be back so soon. He said perhaps to-morrow,
but more likely next week."</p>

<p>"Next week!" cried Mr. Rule; "then he may
just as well stay away altogether; it will then be
too late."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Mrs. John, politely, willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
show an interest; but she did not know what more
to say.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you know where he is, ma'am?" said the
anxious clerk: for this was the time when people
said ma'am. "We might send an express after him.
If he were here, things might still be tided over.
Excuse me, Mrs. Vernon, but if you can give me
any information&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mrs. John, "my husband was
going to London, I think. Is it about business, or
anything I may know?"</p>

<p>"All the world will know to-morrow," cried the
agitated clerk, "unless you can give me some assistance.
I don't like to trouble a lady, but what can I
do? Mrs. Vernon, to-morrow is market day, and
as sure as that day comes if he is not here to make
some provision for it, we shall have a run on the
bank."</p>

<p>"A run on the bank!" said Mrs. John, dismayed.
"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that we shall have to pay every note
that is presented us in gold: and that everybody
will rush upon us with our notes in their hands: and
all the people who have deposit accounts will withdraw
their money. It means Ruin," said Mr. Rule,
very much flustered indeed, wiping the perspiration
from his brow. He had an account himself, and a
considerable sum to his credit. Oh, the fool he had
been to let it lie there instead of investing it! but
then, he had been waiting for a good investment, and
in the meantime, Vernon's was as safe, safer than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the Bank of England. He had believed that till
to-day.</p>

<p>Mrs. John sat looking at him with bewildered
eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," she said. "The bank of
course is for that, isn't it? I never understand how
you do it," she added, with a little of the sprightliness
for which she was distinguished. "It has
always been a mystery to me what good it can do
you to take all the trouble of paying people's bills
for them, and locking up their money, and having
all that responsibility; but I cannot deny that it
seems to answer," she concluded with a little
simper.</p>

<p>The harassed clerk looked at her with a pity that
was almost tragic. If she had not been so handsome
and so fine, and surrounded with all these
luxuries, it is very likely he would have been
impatient, and considered her a fool.</p>

<p>He replied gently&mdash;</p>

<p>"I dare say, ma'am, it is difficult for you to form
an idea of business; but I am almost forgetting,
sitting talking to you, how dreadfully serious it is.
If I knew where Mr. Vernon was, I would send a
post-chaise directly. We are lost if he is not here.
They will say&mdash;God knows what they may not say.
For God's sake, ma'am, tell me how I am to find
him?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Rule, I am very, very sorry. If I
had known! but I rather encouraged him to go. He
was looking so poorly. He was going to town, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
sure&mdash;first: and then perhaps to Bath: or he might
go across to France. He has been talking of that.
France&mdash;yes, I suggested it. He has never been on
the Continent. But now I think of it, I don't think
he will go there, for he said he might be home
to-morrow&mdash;though more likely next week."</p>

<p>"It seems very vague," said Mr. Rule, looking at
her with a steady look that began to show a gleam of
suspicion; but this was entirely out of place. Mrs.
John answered lightly without any perception even
of what he could mean.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it was vague! it is so much better not
to be tied down. I told him he ought to take me;
but it was settled in a hurry, he was feeling so
poorly."</p>

<p>"Then he has forsaken us!" cried the clerk in a
terrible voice, which shook even her obtuse perceptions.
She gazed at him with a little glow of
anger.</p>

<p>"Forsaken you! Dear me, surely a little holiday
never can matter. Why, the servants could go on
without me for a time. It would never come into
Mr. Vernon's head that you could not manage by
yourselves even for a single day."</p>

<p>The clerk did not answer; it was all such a terrible
muddle of ignorance and innocence, and perhaps of
deep and deliberate guilt. But anyhow, there was
the result beyond all uncertainty. The bank must
come down. Vernon's, which it had taken the work
of generations to build up; Vernon's, which was
safer than the Bank of England. Mr. Rule had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a clerk there, man and boy, for about twenty years.
He had been one of old Mr. Vernon's staff. He had
a pride in the bank as if it had been his own. To
give up Vernon's to destruction seemed more than
giving himself up. But what could the clerks do
without the principal? A lieutenant may fight his
ship if the captain fails, or a subaltern replace his
leader, but what can the clerks do without the head
of the establishment? And he had no authority to
act even if he had known how to act; and every two
or three minutes there would come across him a
poignant recollection of his own deposit. Oh, the
Alnaschar hopes he had built upon that little
fortune, the ways in which it was to serve him!
He tried honestly, however, to put it away from
his mind.</p>

<p>"We could have done well enough on an ordinary
occasion," he said, "and Mr. Vernon generally settles
everything before he goes; but I thought he was
only absent for the day. Mrs. Vernon," he cried,
suddenly, "can't you help us? can't you help us?
It will be ruin for you too."</p>

<p>She stared at him for a moment without speaking,
and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"You make me quite wretched. I don't understand.
I have only a little money in the house.
Would that do any good?" she said.</p>

<p>"How much have you?" said the clerk in his
trouble.</p>

<p>She ran to a pretty ornamental desk and opened
it nervously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I dare say there may be about twenty pounds,"
she said.</p>

<p>He laughed loudly, harshly, a laugh that seemed
to echo through the large, unoccupied room.</p>

<p>"If it were twenty thousand it might do something,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Sir!" said Mrs. John Vernon, standing in a fine
attitude of displeasure by her desk, holding it open
with one hand. She looked like a picture by Sir
Thomas Lawrence, her scarf, for she wore a scarf,
hanging half off her pretty white shoulders, caught
upon one equally white arm, her ringlets waving on
her cheek. His laugh was rude, and then he was
only a clerk. She was all angry scorn from the high
knot of brown hair on the top of her head to the
point of her sandalled shoe.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Rule was as penitent as man could
be. He was shocked beyond measure by his
own brutality. He had forgotten himself&mdash;and
before a lady! He made the most abject
apologies.</p>

<p>"But my interest in the bank will, I hope,
be some excuse. I feel half distracted," he
said; and he added, as he backed out at the
door with painful bows, "Perhaps, ma'am, if you
can think of any means of communicating with
Mr. Vernon, you would let me know; or I will
call later, if we could send an express; nothing
is too much for the chance of having him back
to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the lady, "you are strange managers,
I must say, that cannot get on without my husband
one day."</p>

<p>"It is not that, ma'am; it is not that."</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is. I begin to think it is
only making a fuss," Mrs. John said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3>MISS CATHERINE.</h3>


<p>Poor Mr. Rule rushed out into the night in a
state of despair. It was a summer night, and the
streets of Redborough were still full of the murmur
of life and movement. He came down from the
slope on which Mr. John Vernon's grand new house
was situated, into the town, turning over everything
that it was possible to do. Should he go to the Old
Bank, the life-long rival of Vernon's, and ask their
help to pull through? Even such a humiliation he
would have endured had there been any chance of
success. Should he go to the agent of the Bank of
England? He could not but feel that it was quite
doubtful whether between them they could make up
enough to meet the rush he expected; and were
they likely to do it? Would not the first question
be, "Where is Mr. Vernon?" And where was Mr.
Vernon? Perhaps gone to Bath; perhaps to France,
his wife said. Why should he go to France without
letting any one at the bank know, saying he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
only to be absent for a day? There was no telegraph
in those days, and if he confided Mr. Vernon's story
to the other banks, what would they think of him?
They would say that Vernon was mad, or that he
had&mdash;gone away. There could be no doubt of what
they would say. Rule was faithful to his old service,
and to the honour of the house which had trained
him. He would say nothing about France or Bath.
He would allow it to be understood that Mr. Vernon
had gone to London to get the assistance necessary,
and would come back in a post-chaise before the
offices were open in the morning. And perhaps, he
said to himself, perhaps it was so. God grant it
might be so! Very likely he had not thought it
necessary to enter into the matter to a lady. Poor
thing, with her twenty pounds! that showed how
much she knew of business; but it was very high-minded
and innocent of her to offer all she had. It
showed there was at least no harm in her thoughts.
It gave a momentary ease to the clerk's mind to
think that perhaps this was what Mr. Vernon must
mean. He must have known for some time how
badly things were going, and who could tell that the
sudden expedition of which he had made so little,
only saying when he left the bank the day before
"I shall not be here to-morrow," who could tell that
it was not to help to surmount the crisis, that he
had gone away? Rule turned towards his own
house under the solace of this thought, feeling that
anyhow it was better to get a night's rest, and be
strong for whatever was to happen to-morrow. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
would be a miserable to-morrow if Mr. Vernon did
not bring help. Not only the bank that would go,
but so many men with families that would be thrown
upon the world. God help them! and that money
which stood to his own credit, that balance of which
two or three days before he had been so proud, to
see it standing in his name on those well-kept
beautiful books! All this hanging upon the chance
that Mr. Vernon might have gone to town to get
money! No, he could not go in, and sit down at the
peaceful table where Mrs. Rule perhaps would be
hemming a cambric ruffle for his shirt, or plaiting it
delicately with her own fingers, a thing no laundress
could do to please her&mdash;and the children learning
their lessons. He felt sure that he could not rest;
he would only make her anxious, and why should
she be made anxious as long as he could keep it
from her. It is difficult to say how it was that the
first suggestion of a new possibility took hold of Mr.
Rule's mind. He turned away when he was within a
stone's throw of his own house, saying to himself that
he could not go in, that it was impossible, and walked
in the opposite direction, where he had not gone
far until he came in sight of the bank, that centre of
so many years' hard work, that pride of Redborough,
and of everybody connected with it. Vernon's! To
think that Ruin should be possible, that so dark a
shadow could hover over that sacred place. What
would old Mr. Vernon have said, he who received it
from his father and handed it down always flourishing,
always prosperous to&mdash;not to his son. If his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
son had lived, the eldest one, not he who had gone
wrong, but the eldest, who was John too, called
after his grandfather, he who was the father of&mdash;&mdash; It
was at this point that Mr. Rule came to a dead stop,
and then after a pause wheeled right round, and
without saying another word to himself walked
straight up Wilton Street, which as everybody knows
was quite out of his way.</p>

<p>The father of &mdash;&mdash; Yes, indeed, indeed, and that
was true! The recollection which called forth this
fervour of affirmation was a pleasant one. All the
youth of Redborough at one time had been in love
with Catherine Vernon. The bank clerks to a man
adored her. When she used to come and go with
her grandfather&mdash;and she did so constantly, bringing
him down in the morning in her pony carriage,
calling for him in the afternoon, running in in the
middle of the day to see that the old gentleman had
taken his biscuits and his wine&mdash;she walked over
their hearts as she crossed the outer office, but so
lightly, so smoothly, that the hearts were only
thrilled, not crushed by her footfall, so firm and
swift, but so airy as it was. She knew them all in
the office, and would give her hand to the head
clerk, and send a friendly glance all round, unaware
of the harm she was doing to the hapless young
men. But after all it was not harm. It was a
generous love they felt for her, like the love of
chivalry for a lady unapproachable. That young
princess was not for them. None of them grew
mad with foolish hopes, but they thought of her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
they never thought of any one else. Mr. Rule was
at the end of Wilton Street, just where it meanders
out towards the edge of the common, before he took
breath, and began to ask himself what Miss Vernon
could do for him. Was not one lady enough to
appeal to? She whom he had already seen had
nothing for him&mdash;no help, no advice, not a suggestion
even. And yet she was more closely connected with
the bank than Catherine Vernon, who had disappeared
from all visible connection with it at her
grandfather's death, notwithstanding that a great
deal of her money was in it, and that she had in
fact a right to be consulted as a partner. So it had
been settled, it was said, by the old man in his will.
But she had never, so far as anybody knew, taken up
this privilege. She had never come to the bank,
never given a sign of having any active interest in
it. What then could she be expected to do? What
could she do even if she wished to help them? Mr.
Rule was aware that there was no very cordial
feeling between her cousin's house and hers. They
were friends, perfectly good friends, but they were
not cordial. While he turned over these thoughts
in his mind, however, he walked on steadily and
quickly without the least hesitation in his step.
There was even a sort of exhilarated excitement in
him, a sentiment quite different from that with
which he had been disconsolately straying about,
and painfully turning over possibilities, or rather
impossibilities. Perhaps it was a half romantic
pleasure in the idea of speaking to Miss Vernon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
again, but really there was something besides that, a
sense of satisfaction in finding a new and capable
mind to consult with at least, if no more.</p>

<p>Miss Vernon lived in the house which her grandfather
had lived in and his father before him. To
reach it you had to make your way through the
delta of little streets into which Wilton Street ran,
and across a corner of the common. The Grange
was an old house with dark red gables appearing
out of the midst of a clump of trees. In winter
you saw the whole mass of it, chiefly old bricks,
though these were thrown up and made picturesque
by the fact that the oldest part was in grey stone.
Broad large Elizabethan windows glimmered, lighted
up, through the thick foliage this evening; for by
this time the summer night was beginning to get
dark, and a good deal too late for a visit. Mr. Rule
thought as he knocked at the door that it was very
likely she would not see him. But this was not the
case. When he sent in his name as the head clerk
at the bank he was received immediately, and shown
into the room with the Elizabethan windows where
she was sitting. By this time she was of mature
years, and naturally much changed from the young
girl he had known. He had been one of the young
clerks in the outer office, whom she would recognise
with a friendly smiling look, and a nod of her head
all round. Now, however, Miss Vernon came up to
him, and held out her hand to Mr. Rule. "You
need not have sent me word who you were," she said
with a smile. "I knew quite well who you were.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
I never forget faces nor names. You have not come
to me at this time of night on a mere visit of civility.
Don't be afraid to tell me at once whatever there
may be to say."</p>

<p>"From the way you speak, ma'am," said Mr. Rule,
"I conclude that you have heard some of the wicked
reports that are flying about?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I want to know," she said,
with all her old vivacity. "Are they wicked
reports?"</p>

<p>"A report is always wicked," said Mr. Rule
sententiously, "which is likely to bring about the
evil it imagines."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried. "Then it is no further gone
than that; and yet it is as far gone as that?" she
added, looking anxiously in his face.</p>

<p>"Miss Vernon," said Rule solemnly, "I expect a
run upon the bank to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Good God!" she said, clasping her hands; which
was not a profane exclamation, but the kind of half-conscious
appeal which nature makes instinctively.
"But you have made all preparations? Surely you
can meet that."</p>

<p>He shook his head solemnly. The credit of the
bank was so much to him that when thus face to
face with the event he dreaded, poor Rule could
not articulate anything, and the water stood in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Good God!" she said again: but her face was
not awe-stricken; it was that of a soldier springing
instantly to the alert, rallying all his resources at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
first word of danger; "but you don't mean to say
that my cousin&mdash;does not John know this? They
say everybody knows these things before the person
concerned. Why, why did you not warn him,
Mr. Rule?"</p>

<p>Rule shook his head.</p>

<p>"It isn't possible that he could have been ignorant.
How could he be ignorant, ma'am? God
knows I have not a word to say against Mr. Vernon&mdash;but
to think he should forsake us in our moment
of trial!"</p>

<p>"Forsake you!" A sudden flush flew over Miss
Vernon's face&mdash;a spark shot out of her eyes. Indignation
and yet doubt was in her face. "That is
not possible," she cried, holding her head high; and
then she said anxiously, "Mr. Rule, tell me what
you mean?"</p>

<p>"I dare say it is the falsity of appearances," said
poor Rule. "I am sure I hope so. I hope Mr.
Vernon has gone away to get help, personally: you
can do that so much better than writing: and that
he may be back in time to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Has he gone away?" she said in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, Miss Vernon&mdash;I can't help saying
unfortunately, for it paralyses everybody else. We
can do nothing at the bank. But I cling to the
hope that he will be back before the bank is opened.
Oh, yes, I cling to the hope. Without that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything will be lost?"</p>

<p>"Everything!" cried he, who was so proud of being
the head clerk at Vernon's, with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>And then there was a pause. For a minute or
two not a word was said. The daughter of the
house was as much overcome by the thought as was
its faithful servant. At last she said faintly, but
firmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Rule, I cannot believe but that you will see
John to-morrow when the bank is opened, with
means to meet every demand."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Vernon, that is my conviction too."</p>

<p>But in what a faltering voice was this conviction
stated! The room was not very light, and they did
not distinguish very clearly each other's faces.</p>

<p>"But in case of any failure&mdash;" she said, "for of
course one never can tell, the most tiresome nothings
may detain you just when speed is most important;
or he might not have succeeded as he hoped. In
case of any&mdash;delay&mdash;I shall be there, Mr. Rule; you
may calculate upon me, with every penny I can
muster&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You, Miss Vernon!" the clerk said, with a cry
of relief and joy.</p>

<p>"Certainly; who else, when the credit of the bank
is at stake? I have been living very quietly, you
know. I spend next to nothing; my mother's money
has accumulated till it is quite a little fortune, I
believe. What had I best do? send to Mr. Sellon
and ask him to help us on that security? I don't
think he will refuse."</p>

<p>"If you do that we are saved," said Rule, half
crying. "That is the thing to do. What a head
for business you have!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>She smiled, and gave him a little nod, like one of
those happy nods she used to give to the young
clerks in her fine youthful days, in which there was
a kind acknowledgment of their admiration, a friendly
good fellowship with themselves.</p>

<p>"I hope I am not old Edward Vernon's grand-daughter
for nothing," she said, beginning to walk
up and down the room with a buoyant impatience,
as though longing for the moment of exertion to
come. "I had better write to Mr. Sellon at once;
there is no time to lose."</p>

<p>"And if you will let me I will take the note
directly, and bring you an answer."</p>

<p>"Bravo! that is promptitude," cried Miss Vernon;
and she went up to him and held out her hand.
"Between us we will keep the old place going," she
said, "whoever may give in."</p>

<p>If Mr. Rule had not been the steady, bashful
Englishman he was, he would have kissed that hand.
He felt that there was in it enough to save everything&mdash;the
bank first, and then his own little bit of
money, and his situation, and his children's bread.
He had not allowed himself to think of these things
in the greatness of his anxiety in respect to Vernon's;
but he did think of them now, and was ready to cry
in the relief of his soul.</p>

<p>Never was an evening more full of occupation.
Mr. Sellon, who was the agent of the Bank of England
in Redborough, was fortunately at home, and
responded at once to Miss Vernon's appeal. Mr.
Rule had the gratification of walking back with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to the Grange, whither he hastened to reply in
person, and of assisting at the interview afterwards
with a sense of pride and personal advancement
which heightened the satisfaction of his soul. Miss
Vernon insisted strongly on the point that all
these preparations were by way of precaution
merely.</p>

<p>"My cousin will no doubt be back in time, fully
provided; but of course you never can be perfectly
certain. Horses may break down, shafts be broken;
the least little accident may spoil everything. Of
course John put off such a step till the last moment,
and thought it better to keep it entirely to himself."</p>

<p>"Of course," cried Rule, speaking out of his
corner; and "Of course," but much more faintly,
Mr. Sellon said.</p>

<p>"That is so evident that it requires no repetition:
but just as naturally Mr. Rule was alarmed, and had
the good sense to come to me."</p>

<p>All this was by way of convincing Mr. Sellon that
the whole matter was perfectly simple, and that
probably his resources would not be called upon at
all. To be sure, as in every case of a similar kind,
Miss Vernon might have saved herself the trouble,
the circumstances being far more clearly known to
Mr. Sellon than to herself. He was very sure that
John Vernon would not return, and that his intention
was to get himself out of it. Everybody had
known it was coming. It was just as well to humour
a lady, and accept her version as the right one; but
he was not for a moment deceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course the bank," he said, "will make it up
to you afterwards."</p>

<p>"Of course," she said; "and if not, I don't know
who is to stop me from doing what I like with
my own."</p>

<p>He asked a few questions further, in which there
was a good deal of significance, as for instance something
about Mrs. John Vernon's marriage settlements,
which neither of the others for the moment understood.
Rule saw Mr. Sellon to the door, by Miss
Vernon's request, with great pride, and went back
to her afterwards, "as if he were one of the family,"
he described to his wife afterwards.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Oh, more than satisfied, happier than I can tell
you," cried the clerk. "The bank is saved!"</p>

<p>And then she, so triumphant, buoyant, inspired as
she was, sank down upon a chair, and put her head in
her hands, and he thought cried; but Rule was not a
man to spy upon a lady in the revulsion of her feelings.
When she looked up again she said to him quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"In any case, Mr. Rule, we are both sure that
my cousin is doing all he can for the bank; if he
succeeds or not is in other hands."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Miss Vernon, quite sure," Rule replied
promptly. He understood that she meant it to be
understood so, and determined within himself that
he was ready to go to the stake for the new dogma.
And then he related to her his interview with Mrs.
John, and her willingness to give him up her twenty
pounds to save the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Vernon's first flush of indignation soon yielded
to amusement and sympathy. She laughed and she
cried.</p>

<p>"That shall always be remembered to her credit,"
she said. "I did not think she had any feeling for
the bank. Let us always remember it to her credit.
She was ready to give all she had, and who can do
any more?"</p>

<p>Mr. Rule was somewhat intoxicated with all these
confidences, and with the way in which Miss Vernon
said "we"&mdash;his head was a little turned by it. She
was a woman who understood what it was to have
a faithful servant. No doubt, after the sacrifice she
was making, she would, in future, have more to do
with the business, and Rule could scarcely keep his
imagination from straying into a consideration of
changes that might be. Instead of merely being
head clerk, it was quite possible that a manager
might be required; but he pulled himself up, and
would not allow his thoughts to carry him so far.</p>

<p>Next day everything happened as had been foreseen.
There was a run on the bank, and a moment of great
excitement; but when Miss Vernon was seen at the
door of the inner office smiling, with her smile of
triumphant energy and capability, upon the crowd,
and when the Bank of England porters appeared
bringing in those heavy boxes, the run and all the
excitement subsided as by magic. The bank was
saved; but not by John Vernon. The outside world
never was aware how the matter was settled. But
John did not come back. He would have met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
nothing but averted looks and biting words, for there
could be no doubt that he had abandoned his post,
and left Vernon's to its fate. Messrs. Pounce and
Seeling had a good deal to do about the matter, and
new deeds were drawn, and old deeds cancelled to a
serious extent; but the bank ever after remained in
the hands of Miss Vernon, who, it turned out, had
more than her grandfather's steady power of holding
on, and was, indeed, the heir of her great-grandfather's
genius for business. The bank throve in
her hands as it had done in his days, and everything
it touched prospered. She deserved it, to be sure,
but everybody who deserves does not get this fine
reward. There is something beyond, which we call
good luck or good fortune, or the favour of Heaven;
but as Heaven does not favour all, or even most of
the best people in this way, we have to fall back
upon a less pious phraseology. Is it, perhaps, genius
for business, as distinct as genius in poetry, which
makes everything succeed? But this is more than any
man can be expected to understand. Rule attained
all the heights of those hopes which had vaguely
dawned on him out of the mist on that July evening
when his good angel suggested to him Catherine
Vernon's name. He was raised to the dignity of
manager as he had foreseen. His salary was doubled,
his sons were provided for, and he grew old in such
comfort and general esteem as he had never dreamed
of. "This is the man that saved the bank," Miss
Vernon would say. And though, of course, he deprecated
such high praise, and declared that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
was nothing but the humblest instrument, yet there
can be no doubt that he came to believe it in the
end, as his wife and all his children did from the
beginning.</p>

<p>Miss Vernon's was a reign of great benevolence,
of great liberality, but of great firmness too. As
she got older she became almost the most important
person in Redborough. The people spoke of her,
as they sometimes do of a very popular man, by
her Christian name. Catherine Vernon did this
and that, they said. Catherine Vernon was the first
thought when anything was wanted either by the
poor who needed help, or the philanthropist who
wanted to give it. The Vernon Almshouses, which
had been established a hundred years before, but
had fallen into great decay till she took them in
hand, were always known as Catherine Vernon's
Almshouses. Her name was put to everything.
Catherine Street, Catherine Square, Catherine places
without number. The people who built little houses
on the outskirts exhausted their invention in varying
the uses of it. Catherine Villas, Catherine Cottage,
Catherine Mansion, were on all sides; and when it
occurred to the High Church rector to dedicate the
new church to St. Catherine of Alexandria, the common
people, with one accord, transferred the invocation
to their living patroness. She was, at least, a
saint more easily within reach, and more certain to
lend a favourable ear.</p>

<h3>THE VERNONRY.</h3>


<p>These things all happened a great number of
years before the beginning of this history. Catherine
Vernon had become an old woman&mdash;at least she was
sixty-five; you can call that an old woman if you
please. Sometimes it may mean the extreme of
age, decrepitude and exhaustion: but sometimes
also it means a softer and more composed middle
age&mdash;a lovely autumnal season in which all the
faculties retain their force without any of their
harshness, and toleration and Christian charity replace
all sharpness of criticism or sternness of
opinion. Sometimes this beautiful age will fall to
the lot of those who have experienced a large share
of the miseries of life and learnt its bitterest
lessons, but often&mdash;and this seems most natural&mdash;it
is the peaceful souls who have suffered little to whom
this crown of continuance is given. Catherine
Vernon belonged to the last class. If her youth
had not been altogether happy, there had been fewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
sorrows and still fewer struggles in her life. She
had gone along peacefully, her own mistress, nobody
making her afraid, no one to be anxious about, no
one dear enough to rend her heart. Most people
who have gone through the natural experiences of
life are of opinion with the Laureate, that it is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Better to have loved and lost<br /></div>
<div class="verse">Than never to have loved at all."<br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But then we do not allow the other people to
speak who know the other side of the question. If
love brings great happiness it brings many woes.
Catherine Vernon was like Queen Elizabeth, a dry
tree&mdash;while other women had sons and daughters.
But when the hearts of the mothers were torn with
anxiety, she went free. She had the good of other
people's children in a wonderful degree, but it was
impossible she could have the harm of them&mdash;for
those whom she took to were the good children, as
was natural, the elect of this world. Her life had
been full of exertion and occupation since that night
when Rule called upon her at the Grange and set
all the world of her being in movement. What
flagging and loneliness might have been hers&mdash;what
weariness and longing had ended at that time.
Since then how much she had found to do! The
work of a successful man of business increased, yet
softened by all the countless nothings that make
business for a woman, had filled her days. She was
an old maid, to be sure, but an old maid who never
was alone. Her house had been gay with young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
friends and tender friendship. She had been the
first love of more girls than she could count. By
the time she was sixty-five she was a sort of amateur
grandmother in numbers of young households. A
woman with plenty of money, with a handsome,
cheerful house, and a happy disposition, she had&mdash;at
least since her youth was over&mdash;never had occasion
to remember the want of those absorbing
affections which bind a married woman within her
own circle. The children of the barren in her case
were more than those of any wife. If ever in her
heart she said to herself, like Matthew in the
poem&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Many love me, yet by none<br /></div>
<div class="verse">Am I enough beloved,"<br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>the sentiment never showed, and must have
occurred only as Matthew's did, in moods as evanescent
as the clouds. Her face was not without lines,
for that would be to say that it was without expression;
nor did she look too young for her age:
but her eye was not dim, nor her natural force
abated. She had a finer colour than in her girlhood,
though the red was not so smooth, but a little broken
in her soft cheek. Her hair was white and beautiful,
her figure ample, but graceful still. At sixty she
had given up work, entering upon, she said, the
Sabbatical period of her life. For the rest of her
days she meant to keep Sunday, resting from her
labours&mdash;and indeed, with perhaps too close a
following of the divine example for any human
creature to venture upon, finding them very good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>It follows as a matter of course that she had
found somebody to replace her in the bank. There
were so many Vernons, that this was not very
difficult to do. At least it was not difficult to find
candidates for so important a post. Descendants
of the brothers and sisters of the great John
Vernon, who had first made the bank what it was,
were plentiful, and from among them Catherine
Vernon selected two hopeful young men to carry on
her work. One of them, Harry Vernon, was descended
from the daughter of the great John, who
had married a relation and continued to bear the
family name. The other went further back and
traced his descent from a brother of that great John.
The parents of these fortunate young men acquiesced
with delight in the proposals she made to them. It
was a certain fortune&mdash;an established living at once&mdash;far
better than the chances of the Bar, or the
Indian Civil Examinations, or Colorado, which had
begun to be the alternative for young men. Indeed
it was only Edward Vernon who had parents to be
consulted. Harry had but a sister, who had come
to live with him in the fine house which the last
John, the one who had put the bank in such deadly
peril, had built. Edward lived with Miss Vernon
herself. Five years had passed since their inauguration
as partners and managers, with very little
change in their feelings towards the old cousin, who
had done so much for them, and whom they called
Aunt Catherine. She was Aunt Catherine to a
great many people, but these three, who were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
nearest to her in blood, were disposed to give themselves
airs, and to punish intruders who presumed
upon a fictitious relationship. They were to all
appearance quite satisfactory young people, if perhaps
not brilliant; and pious persons said that Miss
Vernon had got her reward for her kindness to the
poor, and her more than kindness to her poor relations.
She was surrounded by those who were to
her like children of her own. No mother could
have had sons more respectful and devoted. Good
and virtuous and kind children&mdash;what could a
woman have more?</p>

<p>Perhaps this was rather a flattering and ideal
statement of the case; but at all events one of the
young men satisfied all Miss Vernon's requirements,
and they were both steady-going, fine young fellows,
paying every attention to business, keeping everything
going. Ellen perhaps was not quite so satisfactory.
She was young and headstrong, and not
sure that Catherine Vernon was all that people
made her out to be. There was nothing wonderful
in this. To hear one person for ever applauded is
more likely than anything else to set an impatient
mind against that person&mdash;and Ellen kept her old
cousin at arm's length, and showed her little affection.
Nobody could doubt that this must have
vexed Miss Vernon, but she took it with wonderful
calm.</p>

<p>"Your sister does not like me," she said to Harry;
"never mind, she is young, and she will know better
one day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must not think so," Harry said. "Ellen
is foolish and headstrong, but she has a very good
heart."</p>

<p>Catherine Vernon nodded a little and shook her
head.</p>

<p>"It is not a heart," she said, "that is disposed
towards me. But never mind; she will think better
of it one day."</p>

<p>Thus you will see that Miss Vernon escaped from
the worst, and had the best, of motherhood. What
a bitterness to her heart would this alienation have
been, had Ellen been her child! but as the troublesome
girl was not her child in reality, the unkindness
vexed her in a very much less degree. She was able
to think of the boys, who were so good, without
being disturbed by the image of the girl, who was
not so good. And so all things went on serenely,
and the years went by, gentle, unremarkable,
tranquil years.</p>

<p>Several years before this, before indeed the young
people had entered into her life, the old house, called
the Heronry, came into Miss Vernon's hands. It was
at some distance on the same side of the Common,
but a little further out towards the country than the
Grange&mdash;a large old red-brick house, in the midst of
a thin but lofty group of trees. Though it was so
near the town, there was something forlorn in it,
standing out against the west, the tall trees dark
against the light, the irregular outline of the old
house flush against the sky, for it was a flat country,
no hills or undulations, but everything that was tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
enough showing direct against the horizon in a way
that was sometimes very impressive. This great old
house Miss Vernon made a curious use of. It contained
a multitude of rooms, not any very large
except that which occupied the centre of the area,
a sort of hall, with a great staircase going out of it.
From the moment it came into her hands, she made,
everybody thought, a toy of the Heronry. She
divided it into about half a dozen compartments,
each with a separate entrance. It was very cleverly
done, so as not to interfere in any way with the
appearance of the place. The doors were not new
and unsightly, but adapted with great care, some of
them being windows a little enlarged. What was it
for? All kinds of rumours ran about the town. It
was some sort of a convent which she was going to
institute, a community of an apostolical kind, a
sisterhood, a hospital, a set of almshouses. Some
went so far as to call it Catherine Vernon's Folly.
She spent a great deal of money upon it, elaborating
her whim, whatever it might be. It was fitted up
with apparatus for warming, which would make the
dwellers in it independent of fires, people said, and
this looked like a hospital everybody allowed. There
was no end to the conveniences, the comforts of the
place. The old-fashioned gardens were put in order,
and the greatest trouble taken to make the old pool&mdash;which
had got the place its name, and where it
was said that herons had actually been seen in the
lifetime of some old inhabitants&mdash;wholesome and
without prejudice to the health of the house. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
pool itself was very weird, and strange to be so near
the dwelling of ordinary life. It lay in the centre of
the clump of trees which had once been a wood, and
which round it had grown tall and bare, with clumps
of foliage on the top, and straight, long stems
mounting to the sky, and shining in long lines of
reflection in the still, dark water. Several gaunt
and ghostly old firs were among them, which in the
sunset were full of colour, but in twilight stood up
black and wild against the clear, pale sky. This
pool was about as far from the Grange as Miss
Vernon could walk with comfort, and it was a walk
she was very fond of taking on summer nights. The
Common lay between the house and the town;
beyond it spread the long levels of the flat country.
In the summer all was golden about, with gorse and
patches of purple heather, and the abundant growth
of wild, uncultivated nature. What did Catherine
Vernon mean to do with this house? That was
what all Redborough wanted to know.</p>

<p>By the time at which this story properly begins,
Redborough had been acquainted for years with Miss
Vernon's intentions; they were indeed no longer intentions,
but had been carried out. The Heronry
had changed its name, if not formally, yet in familiar
parlance, throughout all the neighbourhood, and was
called the Vernonry even by people who did not
know why. The six dwellings which had been contrived
so cleverly were all occupied by relations and
dependents of the family, members of the house of
Vernon, or connections of the same. They made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
little community among themselves, but not the
community of a sisterhood or a hospital. It was
said that they had their little internal feuds and
squabbles, as people living so close together are
always supposed to have, but they were sufficiently
well bred, or sufficiently in awe of their cousin and
patroness, to keep these quarrels decorously to themselves.
How far they were indebted to her for their
living, as well as their lodging, nobody knew, which
was not for want of many a strenuous investigation
on the part of the neighbourhood; but the inmates
of the Vernonry were clever enough to keep their
own counsel on a matter which involved their own
consequence and credit. Disagreeable things were
indeed said about "genteel almshouses," and "poor
relations," when it first became a question in
Redborough about calling on the new residents.
But, as it turned out, they were all persons of pretensions,
expecting to be called upon by the county,
and contemptuous of the townspeople. Five of the
six apartments into which the old house had been
divided were occupied, when Redborough was startled
by the extraordinary intelligence that the last and
best had been reserved for no less interesting an
inmate than Mrs. John Vernon, she who had left the
town in circumstances so painful. John Vernon, the
unfortunate or the culpable, who had all but ruined
the bank, and left it to its ruin, had died abroad.
His wife's marriage settlement had secured their
income, but he had spent as much as it was possible
to spend of that, and forestalled every penny that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
could manage to forestall. His debts were such that
his widow's income was sadly crippled by the necessity
of paying them, which it was said she would not
herself have seen so clearly but for the determined
way in which it was taken up by her child, a very
young girl, born long after the catastrophe, but one
who was apparently of the old stock, with a head for
business, and a decision of character quite unusual in
a child. Mrs. John's return caused a great sensation
in Redborough. She was very well connected, and
there could be no question on anybody's mind as to
the propriety of calling on a woman who was aunt
to Sir John Southwood, and first cousin to Lady
Hartingale. How she could like to come back there,
to live within sight of her own beautiful house, and
to be indebted for shelter to Catherine Vernon, was
a much more difficult matter to understand. But
as everybody said, that of course was Mrs. John's
own concern. If she could make up her mind to it,
certainly nobody else had any call to interfere.</p>

<p>But what a change it was from the fatal day when
poor Mr. Rule, all anxious and miserable, was shown
in by the curious servant to the costly drawing-room
in which John Vernon's wife, in her spotted muslin,
sat ignorant of business, but confident and satisfied
in her good fortune and in the certainty that all
would go well with her! Poor lady! she had learned
some few things since that day, but never had
grasped the mystery of her downfall, nor known
how it was that everything had collapsed in a moment,
tumbling down like a house of cards. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
had not, indeed, tried to understand at that terrible
time when it all burst upon her&mdash;when the fact that
she had to leave her house, and that her furniture
was going to be sold in spite of all her indignant
protestations, compelled her understanding, such as
it was, into the knowledge that her husband was
ruined. She had too much to do then, in crying,
in packing, in appealing to heaven and earth to
know what she had done to be so cruelly used, and
in trying to make out how she was to travel, to be
able to face the problem how it had all come about.
And after she went away the strangeness and novelty
of everything swept thought out of her mind, if,
indeed, it ever entered there at all. Perhaps it was
only after that life was over, and when widowed and
growing old she came back to the strange little house
which Catherine Vernon had written to offer her,
that she remembered once more to ask herself the
question. Or, perhaps, even then it was not she who
asked it, but Hester, who, greatly excited, with eyes
large with curiosity and interest, clinging to her
mother's arm in a way she had, which looked like
dependence, and was control, went all over the new-old
place with her, drinking in information. Hester
led her mother wherever she pleased, holding her
arm embraced in her own two clasped hands. It
was her way of holding the helm. She was a tall
girl of fourteen when she came to the Heronry, outgrowing
all her frocks, and all her previous knowledge,
and thirsting to understand everything. She
had never been in England before, though she prided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
herself on being an English girl. She knew scarcely
anything about her family, why it was they lived
abroad, what was their history, or by what means
they were so severed from all relationships and
friendships. The letter of Catherine Vernon offering
them a house to live in had roused her, with all
the double charm of novelty and mysterious, unknown
relationship. "Who is she? Cousin Catherine?
Papa's cousin! Why is she so kind? Oh
yes, of course she must be kind&mdash;very kind, or she
would not offer us a house. And that is where you
used to live? Redborough. I should think in a
week&mdash;say a week&mdash;we might be ready to go." It
was thus that she carried her mother along, who at
the first did not at all intend to go. Hester arrived
at the curious old house, which was unlike anything
she had ever seen before, with eyes like two notes of
interrogation, brilliant, flaming, inquiring into everything;
and as soon as her mother had rested, and
had taken that cup of tea which is an Englishwoman's
comfort, the girl had her out to see what was to be
seen, and led her about, turning the helm now one
way, now another. The Grange was visible as soon
as they got beyond their gate, and on the other side
of the red roofs of Wilton Street, standing on the
only height that exists in the neighbourhood, there
was the white and splendid "elevation" of the White
House, still splendid, though a little the worse for
wear. Mrs. John stood still, resisting the action of
the helm unconsciously, and all at once began to cry.
"That is where we used to live," she said, with little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
sobs breaking in, "that&mdash;that is where we lived when
we married. It was built for me; and now to think
I have nothing to do with it&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>It was then that the question arose, large, embracing
the entire past, and so many things that were
beyond the mother's knowledge&mdash;"Why did papa go
away?" Mrs. John cried, she could not help it,
feeling in a moment all the difference, the wonderful
change, the downfall and reversal of everything
that in those days she had expected and hoped. She
dried her eyes half a dozen times, and then burst out
again. "Oh, what have I done that so much should
happen to me! and Catherine Vernon always the
same," she said. After a while Hester ceased to ask
any questions, ceased to impel her mother this way
or that by her arm, but led her home quietly to the
strange house, with its dark wainscot, which was so
unfamiliar, and made her lie down upon the sofa.
Mrs. John was not a person of original impulses.
What she did to-day she had done a great many
times before. Her daughter knew all her little
ways by heart. She knew about how long she
would cry, and when she would cheer up again;
and in the meantime she did her best to put two
and two together and make out for herself the outline
of the history. Of course she was all wrong.
She had heard that her father was the victim of a
conspiracy, and she had never seen him on any but
his best side. Her idea was he had been wronged;
perhaps he was too clever, perhaps too good, for the
designing people round him, and they had laid their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
heads together and procured his ruin. The only
thing that puzzled Hester was the share that the
unknown Cousin Catherine had in it. Had she been
against him too? But, if so, why was she kind to
his wife and child? Perhaps out of remorse and
compunction? Perhaps because she was an old
woman, and wanted to make up a little for what she
had done? But this was all vague, and Hester was
prudent enough not to make up her mind about it
until further inquiries. She put her mother to bed
in the meantime, and did all the little things for her
which were part of Mrs. John's system. She brushed
her hair, still so pretty; she tied nicely, as if it were
an article of full dress, the strings of her nightcap;
she put all her little things by her on the table by
her bedside&mdash;her Bible and prayer-book, the novel
she had been reading on the journey, a biscuit in case
she should wake up feeling faint in the night. There
was quite an array of small matters. And then
Hester kissed her mother and bid her go to sleep.
"You will not be long of coming to bed, dear?" Mrs.
John said; and the girl promised. But she went
away, carrying her candle into one wainscoted room
after another, asking herself if she liked them. She
had been used to big white rooms in France. She
saw gleams of her own face, and reflections of her
light in the deep brown of these walls with a
pleasant little thrill of alarm. It was all very
strange, she had never seen anything like it before;
but what was the reason why papa left? What had
he done? What had been done to him? One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the down stairs rooms opened upon a pretty verandah,
into which she was just about stepping, notwithstanding
her dread that the wind would blow her
candle out, when suddenly she was met by a large
and stately figure which made the heart jump in
Hester's breast. Miss Catherine had come out, as
she did so often at night, with a white shawl thrown
over her cap. The road was so quiet&mdash;and if it had
been ever so noisy Catherine Vernon could surely
dress as she pleased, and go as she pleased, from one
place to another in Redborough and its neighbourhood.
She saw coming out upon her in the light of a candle
a pair of brown eyes, large and wide open, full of
eager curiosity, with a tall girl behind them, somewhat
high-shouldered, with clustering curly short
hair. Catherine Vernon was not without prejudices,
and she did not like Mrs. John, nor did she expect
(or perhaps intend) to like her daughter. There was
something in the girl's face which disarmed her suspicion;
but she was not a person to give in, and give
up her foregone conclusion on any such trifling
occasion as that.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>A FIRST MEETING.</h3>


<p>Catherine Vernon had come to see with her own
eyes that her guests or tenants had arrived, and that
they were comfortable. They were relations, which
justified the want of ceremony; but, perhaps, if
they had not been poor, and she had not been their
benefactor, she would scarcely, in so very easy a way,
with a shawl over her cap, and at an hour not
adapted for visits, have made the first call upon
them. She would have been more indignant than
any one at such a suggestion; but human motives
are very subtle, and, no doubt, though she was not
in the least aware of it, this was true. To be sure,
there were circumstances in which such a visit would
have seemed, of all things, the most kind, but not,
perhaps, with persons so little in sympathy as
Catherine Vernon and Mrs. John. She knew she
had been substantially kind. It is so much easier
to be substantially kind than to show that tender
regard for other people's feelings which is the only
thing which ever calls forth true gratitude; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
perhaps Catherine had not altogether escaped the
deteriorating influences of too much prosperity. In
her solitude she had become a great observer of men&mdash;and
women: and was disposed to find much
amusement in this observation. Miss Vernon was
half aware that other motives than those of pure
benevolence affected her mind as she went that
evening to the Vernonry. Curiosity was in it. She
could not but wonder how Mrs. John was feeling,
what she thought of all these changes. She was
glad that her cousin's widow had come home where
she could be looked after, and where it would be
seen that nothing happened to her; but she had
wondered above measure when her offer of shelter
and a home had been accepted, not knowing, of
course, anything about that very active factor in
Mrs. John's affairs, who was known to the people in
Redborough only as "the little girl." Catherine
Vernon thought that she herself, in Mrs. John's
position, would have starved or worked her fingers
to the bone rather than have come back in such a
humiliated condition to the neighbourhood where
she had held so different a place. She was rather
glad to feel herself justified in her contempt of her
cousin's wife by this failure in her of all "proper
pride"; and she allowed curiosity and a sense of
superiority and her low estimate of Mrs. John's
capacity of feeling, to carry the day over her natural
sense of courtesy. What so natural, she said to
herself, as that she should run out and see whether
they had arrived, and if they were comfortable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
establish friendly, easy relations at once, without
waiting for formalities? <i>Qui s'excuse s'accuse.</i> Miss
Vernon certainly knew, at the bottom of her heart,
that sorrow and downfall merited a more respectful
accost; but then Mrs. John had none of those
delicacies of feeling, or it was not in nature that she
would have come at all. And nothing could be more
substantially kind than Catherine knew she had
been. She had engaged an excellent servant for
them&mdash;a woman who had been in her own house,
and who was a capital cook, and capable of taking
a kind of charge as housekeeper if Mrs. John still
remained incapable as of old; and, no doubt, Miss
Vernon thought, there would be a foreign <i>bonne</i> of
some sort or other to take care of "the little girl."
Her own maid accompanied her to the gate, then went
round to the humbler entrance while Miss Vernon
walked through the garden to the pretty verandah
newly put up (but in excellent taste and keeping,
everybody said), which was intended to form a sort
of conservatory in a sunny corner, and give the
inhabitants a little more elegance and modern
prettiness than the other houses afforded. She
had done this on purpose for Mrs. John, who had
got used, no doubt, to foreign ways, sitting out of
doors, and indulgences of that kind. Could anything
have been more kind? And yet, at the bottom of
her heart, Miss Vernon was aware that if she had
resisted her impulse to come and spy upon the poor
traveller this first night, and investigate her feelings,
and how she was supporting the change, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
recollections to be called forth by her return, she
would have been far more really kind. She felt
this, yet she came. What is there in the human
bosom more strong than the desire to see how the
gladiators die? Poor Mrs. John was no gladiator,
but she was upon the point of that sword of suffering
which some writhe and struggle upon, and some
allow themselves to be wounded by, in silence. Miss
Vernon was very anxious to know how she was
bearing it. The daylight, which had come to an
end altogether in the dark wainscoted rooms inside,
was still lingering without. Behind the trees there
was a golden clearness upon the horizon, against
which every branch stood out. The stars were only
half visible in the faint blue. The walk had been
delightful. It was the time she preferred to be
abroad, her mind undisturbed by those cares which
pursue less peaceful people, yielding itself up entirely
to the spell of universal tranquillity and repose.</p>

<p>But when Miss Vernon, opening the glass door
of the verandah, suddenly came in sight of a figure
which was quite unexpected, which she could not
identify or recognise, she was, for the moment, too
much startled to speak. A tall girl of fourteen, in
that large development which so many girls attain
at that early age, to be "fined down" into slim
grace and delicacy afterwards&mdash;with rather high
shoulders, increased by the simple form of her dress;
hair of a chestnut colour, cut short, and clustering
in natural rings and twists&mdash;not curled in the
ordinary sense of the word; a complexion in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
white predominated, the creamy whiteness of a
sanguine temperament, with but little of the rose;
and two large, eager brown eyes, full of curiosity,
full of life, evidently interrogating everything,
coming out, even upon the twilight and the tears
of departing day, with her lighted candle and all-questioning
eyes. There was so much warmth of
life and movement about Hester, that it was difficult
not to feel a certain interest in her; and there was
something wonderfully characteristic in her attitude,
arrested, as she stepped out, like an explorer, with
her candle in her hand.</p>

<p>"I don't know you," said Catherine Vernon, who,
from her general popularity and the worship administered
to her all round, had, perhaps without
knowing it, acquired the familiar ease of expression
which belonged to kind and well-intentioned despots.
The tone of her voice, Hester thought, who was
accustomed to that distinction, was as if she said
"<i>tu</i>." And it depends a great deal upon circumstances
whether it is affection or insult to <i>tutoyer</i> a
stranger. "I don't know you," she said, coming in
without any invitation, and closing the glass door
behind her. "I suppose you must have come with
Mrs. John Vernon. It is not possible," she cried a
moment after, "that you are the little girl?"</p>

<p>"I am all the girl there is. I am Hester: but I
don't know you either," the girl said, determined
not to show any poltroonery or to veil her pretensions
for any one. "Are you Cousin Catherine?" she
added after a moment, with a quick drawn breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I am Cousin Catherine. I came to see how
you have got through your journey, and how your
mother is. I suppose she is your mother? It is
quite astonishing to me to see you look almost like a
grown up young woman, you whom I have always
thought of as the little girl."</p>

<p>"I am fourteen," said Hester. "I never was
very little since I can remember;" and then they
stood and looked at each other under the glass
roof, which still let in some light among the flowers,
their two faces lit up by the flame of the candle.
Hester stood in front of the door which led into
the house, and, indeed, had something the aspect
of a guardian of the house preventing the visitor
from going in. There was a sort of resemblance
to each other in their faces and somewhat
largely developed figures; but this, which
ought to have been a comfortable and soothing
thought, did not occur to either. And it cannot
be denied that the first encounter was hostile on
both sides.</p>

<p>"I should like to see your mother: to&mdash;welcome
her&mdash;home."</p>

<p>"She has gone to bed. She was&mdash;tired," Hester
said; and then, with an effort&mdash;"I do not suppose it
is quite happy for her, just the first night, coming
back to the place she used to live in. I made her
go to bed."</p>

<p>"You take good care of her," said Miss Vernon;
"that is right. She always wanted taking care of."
Then, with a smile, she added, "Am I not to go in?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
I came to see if you were comfortable and had
everything you want."</p>

<p>"Mother will be much obliged," said Hester,
stiffly. She did not know any better. She was not
accustomed to visitors, and was altogether at a loss
what to do&mdash;not to speak of the instinct of opposition
which sprang up in her mind to this first new
actor in the new life which lay vaguely existing and
unknown before her feet. It seemed to her, she
could scarcely tell how, that here was an enemy,
some one to be held at arm's length. As for
Catherine Vernon, she was more completely taken
aback by this encounter than by anything which had
happened for years. Few people opposed her or met
her with suspicion, much less hostility; and the
aspect of this girl standing in the doorway, defending
it, as it were, preventing her from entering, was
half comic, half exasperating. Keeping her out of
her own house! It was one of the drawbacks of
her easy beneficence, the <i>defauts de ses qualit&eacute;s</i>, that
she felt a little too distinctly that it was her own
house, which, seeing she had given it to Mrs. John,
was an ungenerosity in the midst of her generosity.
But she was human, like the rest of us. She began
to laugh, bewildered, half angry, yet highly tickled
with the position, while Hester stood in front of her,
regarding her curiously with those big eyes. "I
must rest here, if I am not to go in," she said.
"I hope you don't object to that; for it is as much
as I can do to walk from the Grange here."</p>

<p>Hester felt as if her lips were sealed. She could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
not say anything; indeed she did not know what she
ought to say. A vague sense that she was behaving
badly made her uncomfortable; but she was not
going to submit, to yield to the first comer, to let
anybody enter who chose. Was she not the guardian
of her mother, and of her quiet and repose? She
shifted her position a little as Miss Vernon sat down
on one of the creaking basket chairs, but did not
even put her candle out of her hand, or relax in her
defensive attitude. When her visitor laughed again,
Hester felt a flush of hot anger, like a flame, going
over her. To be ludicrous is the last thing a girl
can bear: but even for that she would not give in.</p>

<p>"You are a capital guardian," Catherine said,
"but I assure you I am not an enemy. I shall have
to call my maid Jennings, who has gone to the
kitchen to see Betsey, before I go home, for I am not
fond of walking alone. You must try and learn that
we are all friends here. I suppose your mother
has told you a great deal about the Vernons&mdash;and
me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about any Vernons&mdash;except ourselves,"
Hester said.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Miss Vernon, hastily, "you must
not get it into your little head that you are by any
means at the head of the house, or near it. Your
grandfather was only the second son, and you are
only a girl&mdash;if you had been a boy it might have
been different; and even my great-grandfather, John
Vernon, who is the head of our branch, was nothing
more than a cadet of the principal family. So don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
give yourself any airs on that score. All your
neighbours here are better Vernons than you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never give myself any airs&mdash;I don't know what
you mean," said Hester, feeling a wish to cry, but
mastering herself with all the strength of passion.</p>

<p>"Don't you, my poor child? I think you do.
You are behaving in a silly way, you know, meeting
me like this. Your mother should have taught you
better manners. I have no desire but to be kind to
you. But never mind, I will not say anything about
it, for I dare say you are all put the wrong way with
fatigue and excitement; otherwise I should think
you were excessively uncivil, do you know," Miss
Vernon said.</p>

<p>And Hester stood, fiery-red, and listened. If she
had spoken she must have cried&mdash;there was no
alternative. The candle flickered between the two
antagonists. They were antagonists already, as
much as if they had been on terms of equality.
When Miss Vernon had rested as long as she
thought necessary, she got up and bade her young
enemy good-night. "Tell your mother that I have
done my duty in the way of calling, and that it is
she now who must come to me," she said.</p>

<p>Hester stood at the door of the verandah, with her
candle flaring into the night, while Catherine went
round to the other door to call Jennings, her maid,
and then watched the two walking away together
with a mixture of confused feeling which filled her
childish soul to overflowing. She wanted to cry, to
stamp with her feet, and clench her fists, and grind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
her teeth. She was like a child in the unreasoning
force of her passion, which was bitter shame as well.
She had behaved like a savage, like a fool, she knew,
like a little silly, ill-tempered child. She ought to
be whipped for her rudeness, and&mdash;oh, far worse!&mdash;she
would be laughed at. Does not every one
remember the overwhelming, intolerable shame and
mortification which envelope a young creature like a
sudden flame when she perceives that her conduct
has been ludicrous as well as wrong, and that she has
laid herself open to derision and laughter? Oh, if
she could but wipe that hour out of her life! But
Hester felt that never, never could it be wiped out
of her life. She would remember it if she lived to
be a hundred, Miss Vernon would remember it, and
tell everybody what a senseless, rude, ignorant being
she was. Oh, if the earth would open and swallow
her up! She did not wish to live any longer with
the consciousness of this mistake. The first time,
the first time she had been tried&mdash;and she had made
herself ridiculous! The tears came pouring from
her eyes like hail-drops, hot and stinging. Oh, how
she stamped upon the floor! Never more could she
hold up her head in this new place. She had covered
herself with shame the very first hour. All the
self-restraint she could exercise was to keep herself
from flying up stairs and waking her mother in order
to tell her all that had happened. She was not what
people call unselfish&mdash;the one quality which is supposed
to be appropriate to feminine natures. She
was kind and warm-hearted and affectionate, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
was not without thought of herself. Her own little
affairs naturally bulked more largely to her than
everything else in the world. She could scarcely
endure to keep all this to herself till to-morrow.
She had indeed flown up stairs with a cry of
"Mother, mother!" open-mouthed: and then it had
occurred to her that to wake her mother would be
cruel. She was very tired, and she had been more
"upset" than Hester had ever seen her. Probably
she would be still upset in the morning if she were
disturbed now in her slumber. Hester's fortitude
was not sufficient to make her go to bed quietly.
She was almost noisy in her undressing, letting her
hair-brush fall, and pushing the furniture about,
hoping every moment that her mother would wake.
But Mrs. John was very tired, and she was a good
sleeper. She lay perfectly still notwithstanding this
commotion; and Hester, with her heart swelling,
had to put herself to bed at last, where she soon fell
asleep too, worn out with passion and pain&mdash;things
which weary the spirit more than even a day on the
railway or crossing the Channel when there are
storms at sea.</p>

<p>Miss Vernon went home half amused, but more
than half angry. Edward Vernon had not very long
before taken up his abode at the Grange, and he was
very attentive to Aunt Catherine, as many of the
family called her. He came out to meet her when
she appeared, and blamed her tenderly for not calling
him when she went out.</p>

<p>"I do not think you would have been the worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
for my arm," he said. He was a slim young man
with a black beard, though he was still quite young,
and a gentle expression in his eyes. He was one of
those of whom it is said he never gave his parents
an anxious hour; but there was something in his
face which made one wonder whether this was from
genuine goodness, or because he had never yet come
under temptation. This doubt had passed through
Catherine Vernon's mind when she heard all that
his enthusiastic family had to say of him; but it had
worn away in beholding the sweetness of his disposition,
and his gentle, regular life. To see him so
dutiful and gentle was a relief and comfort to her
after the encounter she had just had.</p>

<p>"It would have given you a sensation," she said,
"I promise you, if you had come with me, Edward.
I have just had a meeting with a little spitfire, a
little tiger-cat."</p>

<p>"Who is that, Aunt Catherine?"</p>

<p>Miss Vernon threw her shawl off her cap, and sat
down on the sofa to take breath. She had walked
home faster than usual in the excitement of the
moment.</p>

<p>"If you will believe me," she said, "I don't even
know her name&mdash;except of course that it is Vernon,
John Vernon's daughter. I suppose she must have
been warned against me, and instructed to keep me
at arm's length."</p>

<p>"To keep <i>you</i> at arm's length? That is not
possible."</p>

<p>"Well, it does not look likely, does it?" she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
somewhat mollified. "People are not generally
afraid of Catherine Vernon: but it is singular sometimes
how you will find your own family steeled
against you, when everybody else likes you well
enough. They see you too near at hand, where
there is no illusion possible, I suppose; but that
could not be the case with this little thing, who
never set eyes on me before. She let me know that
her mother was not to be disturbed, and even refused
me admission&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;to my
own house."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure there is no mistake?" said
Edward; "it seems incomprehensible to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do not find it incomprehensible. She is
Mrs. John's daughter, and there never was any love
lost between us. I always felt her to be a vacant,
foolish creature; and no one can tell what a venturesome,
ridiculous hoyden she thought me."</p>

<p>Here Catherine Vernon felt herself grow hot all
over, as Hester had done, bethinking herself of an
encounter not altogether unlike the present, in which
she had enacted Hester's part, and exposed herself
to the ridicule of Mrs. John. Though this was
nearly half a century ago, it had still power to move
her with that overwhelming sense of mortification.
There are things which no one ever forgets.</p>

<p>"When I heard of that woman coming home, I
knew mischief would come of it," Miss Vernon said.</p>

<p>"But forgive me, Aunt Catherine, was it not you
that asked her to come?"</p>

<p>Catherine Vernon laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have me there," she said. "I see you are
quick, and I see you are honest, Edward. Most
people hearing me say that would have been bewildered,
and thought it not possible. No, I did
not bring her. I only said to her, if you are coming,
there is a house here which you are welcome to if
you please. What else could I do?"</p>

<p>"She is not penniless, I suppose. You might
have let her settle where she pleased."</p>

<p>"She is not penniless, but she is heedless and
heartless," said Miss Vernon with a sigh; "and as
for settling where she pleased, of course anyhow she
would have come here. And then, I never expected
she would take it."</p>

<p>"You thought she would come here, and yet you
never expected she would take it; and you knew she
would make mischief, yet you invited her to come.
That is a jumble. I don't make head or tail of it."</p>

<p>"Nor I," cried Miss Vernon, with another laugh.
"You shall carry the problem a little further, if you
please. I feared that her coming would disturb us
all, and yet I am half pleased in my heart, being
such a bad woman, that she is going to make a
disturbance to prove me right. You see I don't
spare myself."</p>

<p>"It amuses you to make out your own motives
as well as other people's: and to show how they
contradict each other," Edward said, shaking his head.</p>

<p>This little bit of metaphysics refreshed Miss
Vernon. She became quite herself again, as she
told him her story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"The little firebrand!" she said, "the little spitfire!
facing me on my own ground, defying me,
Catherine Vernon, in the very Vernonry, my own
creation!"</p>

<p>"I wonder what the child could mean by it; it
must have been ignorance."</p>

<p>"Very likely it was ignorance: but it was more;
it was opposition, firm, healthy, instinctive opposition,
without any cause for it; that is a sort of thing
which it refreshes one to see. It must have been
born in her, don't you see? for she didn't know me,
never set eyes on me. The little wild cat! She
felt in every nerve of her that we were in opposition,
she and I."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you give too much importance
to the nonsense of a girl? I know," said Edward,
with a very serious nod of his head, "what girls are.
I have six sisters. They are strange beings. They
will go all off at a tangent in a moment. Pull a
wrong string, touch a wrong stop, and they are all
off&mdash;in a moment."</p>

<p>"You forget that I was once a girl myself."</p>

<p>"It is a long time ago, Aunt Catherine," said the
ruthless young man. "I dare say you have forgotten:
whereas I, you know, have studied the subject up
to its very last development."</p>

<p>Miss Vernon shook her head at him with a playful
menace, and then the tea was brought in, and lights.
As he went on talking, she could not refrain from a
little self-congratulation. What a wise choice she
had made! Many young men hurried out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
evenings, made acquaintances that were not desirable,
involved themselves in indifferent society.
Edward seemed to wish for nothing better than this
soft home atmosphere, her own company, his books
and occupations. What a lucky choice! and at the
same time a choice that reflected much credit on
herself. She might just as well have chosen his
brother, who was not so irreproachable. As she sat
on the sofa and took her tea, her eyes sought the
figure of the young man, pacing quietly up and
down in the dim space, filling the house and the
room and her mind with a sensation of family completeness.
She was better off with Edward than
many a mother with her son. It was scarcely possible
for Miss Vernon to divest herself of a certain
feeling of complacency. Even the little adventure
with the stranger at the Heronry enhanced this.
Mrs. John, to whom she had been so magnanimous,
to whom she had offered shelter, had always been
against her; she had foreseen it, and if not content
with this incident, was so with herself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<h3>NEXT MORNING.</h3>


<p>When Mrs. John awoke, confused and not knowing
where she was, very early on the next morning, she
was dismayed by the story which was instantly
poured into her half-awakened ears. Hester, it is to
be feared, had not shown that respect for her mother's
slumbers which she had enforced upon Miss Vernon.
The girl was too impatient, too eager to tell all that
had happened. "Of course I was not going to let
her come in and disturb you," she cried. "Is that
how people behave in England? She had not even
a bonnet on. No. I did not ask her to come in. It
was so late: and besides, I never heard of people
making calls at night; people you don't know."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" said Mrs. John, in dismay. "Oh,
Hester! what have you done? Catherine Vernon
turned away from the door! She will never forgive
you, never, as long as she lives."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Hester, almost sullenly. "How
was I to know? Even if I had been quite sure it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
was Cousin Catherine, I should not have let the
Queen come in, to disturb you."</p>

<p>"The Queen of course would never want to come,"
said Mrs. John, who was very literal, "but Catherine
Vernon! she is more than the Queen; the house
belongs to her, and the furniture, and everything.
It is all warmed with hot-water pipes, and servants
kept, and every comfort. I shouldn't wonder if she
turned us out after what you have done."</p>

<p>"If she does, mother, I will be your servant. I
will keep good fires and keep you warm, never fear,"
cried Hester, paling and reddening in panic, yet
courage.</p>

<p>"Good fires!" said Mrs. John; "do you think
fires can be got for nothing? and we have so little
money." She looked very pale and worn, supported
among her pillows in the early morning light so
penetrating and so clear; and at this she began to
cry. "Oh, why was I so foolish as to leave you
to mismanage everything? I might have known!
Whatever Catherine Vernon wanted, you ought to
have let her have it. She can turn us out in a
moment if she pleases, and she will never forgive
you, never. And just when we were going to be so
comfortable!" the poor woman cried.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, don't cry, mamma. You know I
always said I should give lessons. We will get two
nice little rooms somewhere, much nicer than these.
If she is such a hard woman, I don't want to be
obliged to her. Oh, mother, mother, don't cry! <i>I</i>
can take care of you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, hold your tongue, hold your tongue, child!
what do you know about it? Let me get up. I
must go to her at once and tell her you are only
a child, and constantly doing silly things."</p>

<p>This to Hester, who was so conscious of being not
only her mother's prop and support, but her real
guide in life. She was so utterly aghast, that she
did not know how to reply.</p>

<p>"Put me out my best crape," said her mother.
"Catherine will like to see that even in a foreign
place, where it is so difficult to get things as one
ought, proper respect was paid. Everybody said
that she meant to marry your poor papa when she
was young; but he saw me&mdash;Oh, dear, dear, when I
think of all that has happened since then&mdash;and she
never has liked me. I think that was quite natural:
and now that you have gone and made everything
worse&mdash;Put me out my best dress with the crape."</p>

<p>"It is only five o'clock," said Hester, half penitent,
half irritated, "there is nobody up. The people in
England must be very lazy in the morning. Does
no one go to early mass?"</p>

<p>"Five o'clock!" said Mrs. John, fretfully. "I
think you must be going out of your senses, Hester.
Is that an hour to wake me, when I have not had
my first sleep out? Draw down the blinds and close
the shutters, and let me get a proper rest. And for
goodness' sake," she cried, raising her head before
she settled down comfortably among the pillows, "for
goodness' sake! don't go about talking of early
mass here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Hester did as her mother ordered, but with an
impatient heart. It was bitter to have thus put into
the hands of the poor lady who was her kingdom,
and for whom she had legislated for years, the means
of shaking off her sway&mdash;a sway which Hester was
firmly persuaded was for her good. John Vernon
had not been much of a guide for either mother or
child. He had not cared very much about them.
His wife's monotonous feebleness which might have
been well enough in the tranquillity of the luxurious
sheltered life at home to which she was born, was
nothing but tiresome in circumstances where an
energetic woman might have been of some use; and
his daughter was a creature he did not understand&mdash;a
child, a chit, who ventured to look disapproval at
him, to his indignation and wonder. What you are
used to from your birth does not affect you much,
and Hester had not suffered any heartache from her
father's neglect. She accepted it as the order of
nature, but the result had been that from her earliest
consciousness almost, she had taken upon herself the
charge of her mother; and to be thus threatened
with deposition, and criticised by her helpless subject,
appalled her. So active and young as she was, and
full of superfluous strength, it was impossible for
her to return to her pillow as her mother had done.
When she had closed the shutters and drawn the
curtains, she stole softly out on tiptoe down the old
oak staircase which creaked at every footfall. In the
glory of the early morning the house was not dark.
In rooms which the sun had reached, the black old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
wainscot was glimmering full of reflections, and all
the world out of doors lay resplendent in that early
gladness. Hester had heard all her life from many a
discontented mouth, of the gloomy skies and dark
days of England, of a climate always obscured with
fog, and a sky where there was no blue. Accordingly
it was with a kind of indignant ecstasy that she
stepped out into the intense delicious radiance, so
soft and fresh, yet so all-powerful. The birds had
got their early morning twitterings over, and were in
full outburst of song. The flowers were all in intensest
dewy bloom, and everything taking the good of
that sweet prime of the morning in which they
bloomed and sang for themselves, and not officially on
behalf of the world. The girl forgot her vexation as
she came out to the incense-breathing garden, to the
trees no longer standing out black upon the sunset,
but in all their sweet natural variations of colour,
basking in the morning light. The pond even, that
had looked so black, was like a basin of pure gold,
rimmed with rich browns and greens. She opened
the gate and looked out upon the road which was all
silent, not a shadow upon it, swept by the broad early
blaze of the morning sun. Not a sound except the
chorus of the birds, the crackle of the furze bushes
in the stillness, the hum of insects. She had all the
world to herself, as the poet had on that immortal
morning when the houses of quiet London all lay
asleep, and the Thames flowed onward at his own
sweet will. Standing apart from the road, among its
shrubberies, was the Grange with its red gables and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
its eyelids closed&mdash;farther off the light rebounded
softly from the roofs of the town, and behind the
town, revealed in partial shadow, rose the white
distant front of the house in which her mother had
told Hester her early married life had been passed.
She had it all to herself, nobody to disturb or interrupt.
And what in human form could have given a
more complete impersonation of the morning than
this girl, fresh, fair, and strong, with such a world of
latent possibilities in her? The cloud of last night's
perversity blew away. She met the eye of the day
with a gaze as open and as confident. Neither
Nature nor Hester had any fear. She was like her
namesake in the poem, whom the "gentle-hearted
Charles" beloved of all men, could not, though she
was dead, give up the expectation of meeting as
heretofore, "some summer morning."</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And this glorified world, this land of light and
dews, this quiet sweetness and silence and ecstatic
life, was the dull England of which all the shabby
exiles spoke with scorn! Hester felt a delightful
indignation flood her soul. She went out all by
herself with a little awe, and walked round the Common
which was all agleam with blobs of moisture
shining like diamonds in the sun:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hester was a great deal too young for a heroine,
but as it chances there could not be a better portrait
of her than that of Lamb's "sprightly neighbour."
She went out with that springing motion, stepping
on air, with the pride of life and youth and conscious
energy in every vein. A certain youthful contempt
for the inferior beings who lay stupid behind those
closed shutters, losing all this bloom and glory, was
in her heart. She was very black in the midst of
the bright landscape in her mourning frock, with a
white kerchief tied round her throat like a French
girl, but her curly locks shining like everything else
in the sun. She did not mind the sun. She had
not yet learned that she had a complexion to care
for; besides, the sun could do nothing to the
creamy-white of her tint. Perhaps she was not
very sensitive, not thin-skinned at all, either in
body or soul.</p>

<p>Now it happened, curiously enough, that as Hester
passed the gate of the Grange, at which she gazed
very anxiously with a half-formed intention of
making her way in, in face of every obstacle, and
making her peace with Cousin Catherine&mdash;a project
which only the early hour prevented her from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
carrying out&mdash;the said gate opened softly and a man
appeared. Hester was more startled than she could
explain to herself. Why should she be startled? It
was not so early now&mdash;six o'clock or later. He was
a young man of middle height, with a very dark
beard and bright eyes. Hester felt that he was
somewhat unsuitable to the scene, not English in her
opinion&mdash;Englishmen had fair hair, rosy complexions,
blue eyes&mdash;they were all <i>blonds</i>: now this man looked
like those to whom she was accustomed. Was he,
she wondered, going to early mass? He had a portfolio
in his hand, a small box strapped to his shoulders.
The first Englishman she had seen; what was he
going to do? What he did first was to look at her
with considerable curiosity. She had hastily put on
her hat on seeing him, that there might be no impropriety
in her appearance, an action which put out, so
to speak, one of the lights in the landscape, for her
hair was shining almost as brightly as the blobs of
dew. He crossed the road to the Common, and then
he paused a moment on the edge of it and looked at
her again.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you are my little cousin," he said.</p>

<p>It was on Hester's lips to protest that she was not
little at all, but quite as tall as he was, but she
waived this point on second thoughts.</p>

<p>"Are you a Vernon&mdash;<i>too</i>?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a Vernon&mdash;too. Edward, at your
service. I am glad to see you keep such early hours."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, but did not wait for any reply.
"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going," he said, "out upon the Common to
look for a rare flower that grows here, only I have
never been able to find it. Will you come and help
me?"</p>

<p>"A flower!" said Hester, confounded. "Do
Englishmen look for flowers?"</p>

<p>"Englishmen as well as others&mdash;when they happen
to be botanists. Does that surprise you? I am
obliged to get up early, for I have no time in the
day."</p>

<p>"What do you do in the day?" the girl asked.</p>

<p>"I am at the bank. Have you never heard of
Vernon's Bank? the business from which we all
take our importance here. The Vernons are great
or they are small, don't you know? according to their
connection with the bank."</p>

<p>"Then you are one of the great ones," said Hester
with decision. "Do any of the Vernons live in that
great white house&mdash;that one, do you see?&mdash;on the
other side of the red roofs?"</p>

<p>"The White House? Oh yes, Harry lives there,
another cousin, and his sister."</p>

<p>"Are they in the bank too?"</p>

<p>"Harry is; he and I do the work between us.
Ladies in this country have nothing to do with business&mdash;&mdash;by
the way, I am forgetting Aunt Catherine."</p>

<p>"That is a pity," said Hester, not noticing his
exclamation. "Then I suppose my father must have
had something to do with it, for do you know,
though we are poor now, he once lived there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why did he go away?" said Hester
musingly; "that is what I should like to find out.
Do you know Cousin Catherine? you must, if you
live in her house."</p>

<p>"I call her Aunt Catherine," said the young man.</p>

<p>"Why? Is she your aunt? And I call her
cousin; but she cannot be my cousin. She is so
much older. Was she angry&mdash;do you know&mdash;last
night? I did not know who she was&mdash;and I was&mdash;rude."</p>

<p>He laughed, and she, after a doubtful glance,
laughed too.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I am afraid I did know who she was&mdash;that
she was Cousin Catherine; but then, who is
Cousin Catherine? I had never seen her before.
Mother thinks she will be very angry. Could I
let her come in and disturb my mother after she
was in bed? Mother thinks she will not let us
stay."</p>

<p>"Should you be sorry to go?"</p>

<p>Hester cast a long look all round from east to
west, taking in the breadth of the Common glistening
in the morning dew, the dark roofs of the Heronry
against the trees, the glittering vanes and windows of
the town on the other side.</p>

<p>"It is very pretty," she said with a little sigh. "And
to think what they say of England! They say it is
always fog, and the sun never shines. How can
people tell such lies? We should not go, we should
take some small rooms in the town, and I would
teach."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"What could you teach?"</p>

<p>Hester looked at him with half resentment.</p>

<p>"Do you know many languages?" she said.</p>

<p>"Many languages? no!&mdash;a smattering of Greek
and Latin."</p>

<p>"I don't call them languages. I mean French
and Italian and German: for I know them all. I
know them as well as English. I haven't a bit of
the accent Britannique: Madame Alphonse said so,
and I hope she is a good authority. I will give
<i>cours</i>, as many as they please: French one day and
the others the next. Not only should I be able to
help mother, but I should make a fortune, they all
said. Three <i>cours</i> always going: I should make a
great deal of money, and then in ten years or so I
could retire, you know. In ten years I should only
be"&mdash;here she paused in the fervour of conversation
and eyed him a little with doubt in her face. Then
she said quite calmly, "I forget the rest."</p>

<p>Edward Vernon listened with great edification;
he forgot the flower which he was going to search
for.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to discourage you in your plans:
but I don't think Aunt Catherine will turn you out."</p>

<p>"Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>Hester, after her brag, which was perfectly sincere,
and of which she believed every word, felt a little
disappointed to be thus brought down again.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so. She told me that you
were rude, but she was not angry; she only
laughed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>At this Hester grew wildly red, and stamped her
foot. "She shall not&mdash;she shall not&mdash;nobody shall
laugh at me!" she cried. "I will tell mother we
must go away."</p>

<p>"Don't go away. You must consider that your
mother will be a great deal more comfortable here
than in lodgings in town. And you know you are
very young. You had better be a little older before
you begin to give <i>cours</i>. Don't be angry: but if
you were to mount up to the desk with your short
frock" (here Hester looked down at her feet, and in
a sudden agony perceived the difference between her
broad, old-fashioned shoes, and the pointed toes of
her companion) "and short hair&mdash;&mdash;" But this was
more than she could bear.</p>

<p>"You are laughing at me! You too!" she said,
with a poignant tone of mortification.</p>

<p>"No, my little cousin, I will not laugh; but you
must let me be your friend, and show you what is
best; for you <i>are</i> very young, you know. One can't
know everything at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fourteen," said Hester. "Fourteen is not so
very young; and girls are older than boys. Perhaps
you are thinking that a boy of fourteen is not much?
That is very true; but it is different with me.
Mother is not strong. I have to do most of the
settling, not to tire her. What I think is always
what will be the best&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For her? To be sure," said Edward; "so you
must make up your mind to be civil to everybody,
and not to quarrel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quarrel! I never quarrel. I would not for
anything in the world; it is so childish."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall find my flower this morning,"
he said. "I will walk home with you if you
will let me, and we can talk about everything. Have
you seen the other people who live in the Heronry?
Some of them will amuse you. There are two old
ladies&mdash;Vernons, like the rest of us."</p>

<p>"Is it Cousin Catherine that has brought us all
here?"</p>

<p>"All of us. She is not a person to be made light
of, you see."</p>

<p>"And why did she bring <i>you</i>? Were you poor?
Had you no father like me? Is she fond of you that
she has you to live in her house? Do you love
her?" said Hester, fixing her large curious eyes on
the young man's face.</p>

<p>He laughed. "Where am I to begin?" he said.
"I have a father and mother, little cousin. They
are not poor precisely, but neither are they rich. I
can't tell you whether Aunt Catherine is fond of
me. She brought me here to work in the bank; the
bank is everybody's first thought; that must be kept
up whatever fails; and she was so good as to think
I would do. It was a great advancement for me. If
I had stayed at home I should have had to struggle
for something to do along with all the other young
men. And there are a great many young men in
the world, and not so much for them to do as could
be wished. Have I satisfied you now?"</p>

<p>"There is one question you have not answered,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
said Hester. "Do you love her?&mdash;that is the chief
thing I want to know."</p>

<p>"Love her? Come, you must not go into metaphysics.
I like her very much. Aunts are excellent
things. I have a great respect for her. Won't
that do?"</p>

<p>"I looked at her last night," said Hester. "I got
her by heart. I shall either love her or hate her.
I have not made up my mind which."</p>

<p>"There is something between these violent sentiments,"
said Edward; "at least I hope so. You
must not hate me."</p>

<p>"Oh, you!" said Hester, with friendly contempt,
"that is a different thing altogether. You are not
of any consequence. I think I like you, but you
may be sure I shall never hate you; why should I?
You can't do anything to me. But when there is
one that is&mdash;that is&mdash;well, almost like God, you
know&mdash;" said the girl, dropping her voice reverentially.
"It is astonishing, is it not, that one should
be so much more powerful than others? They say
in France that men are all equal; but how can that
be when Cousin Catherine&mdash;What gives her so much
power?"</p>

<p>"That is all a fallacy about men being equal.
You will see through it when you get older," said
Edward, with gentle superiority. He had laughed
at her cavalier mention of himself, but he was very
willing to instruct this self-opinioned young person.
"You are mixing up circumstances and principles,"
he added. "It is circumstances which make Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Catherine powerful; chiefly because she is rich&mdash;rich
and kind; very kind in her way; always ready
to do a charitable action."</p>

<p>The colour wavered in Hester's cheek. "We don't
want charity," she said; and after this walked on
very stately, holding her head high. The Vernonry
towards which they were going had begun to wake
up. Smoke was rising up into the clear air from one
or two of the chimneys; a few blinds had been drawn
up; a gardener, with his wheelbarrow and his scythe
stood in the gate, throwing his shadow across the
garden. Edward Vernon thought there was in the
air a vague perfume from the cups of tea that were
being carried about in all directions to the bedsides
of the inhabitants. The people in the Vernonry
were all elderly; they were all fond of their little
comforts. They liked to open their eyes upon the
world through the refreshing vapour of those early
cups. All elderly&mdash;all except this impersonation of
freshness and youth. What was she to do in such a
place, amid the retired and declining, with energy
enough for every active employment, and a restless,
high, youthful spirit? Poor girl! she would have
some bitter lessons to learn. Edward, though he had
won the heart of his powerful relation by his domestic
character and evident preference for her society, had
not been able to divest himself of a certain grudge
against the author of his good fortune. The feeling
which Hester expressed so innocently was in his
mind in a more serious form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>When they reached the gate, Hester stopped
short.</p>

<p>"You must not come in now," she said in her
peremptory tones, "for mother is not up yet. I
must go and make her coffee before she gets up.
I will make you some, after dinner if you like.
You cannot make coffee in England, can you?"</p>

<p>"No more than we can make the sun shine," said
Edward with a smile. "I shall certainly come for
my coffee in the evening. I may be of some use to
you as your difficulties increase; but I should like
to know your name, and what I am to call you?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure that our difficulties will increase?"
said Hester, aghast, opening her mouth as well as
her large eyes.</p>

<p>"Unless you know how to deal with them. I
shall set up a series of lectures on fine manners and
deportment."</p>

<p>Hester's countenance flamed upon him with
mingled resentment and shame.</p>

<p>"Do you think me a savage?" she said. "I&mdash;do
you know I have been brought up in France? It is
in England that there are no manners, no politeness."</p>

<p>"And no sunshine," said Edward with a laugh.
Thus saying he took off his hat with a little exaggeration
of respect, and waving his hand to her,
turned away. If Hester had been older, she would
have known that to stand and look after him was
not according to any code. But at fourteen the soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
is bold and scorns conventional rule. She stood,
shading her eyes with her hand, watching him as he
walked along; still the only figure that broke the
blaze and the silence of the morning. It was true,
as she had said, that he was not of any consequence.
Perhaps that was why she felt quite at her ease in
respect to him, and on the whole approved of him as
a pleasant feature in the new life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>NEIGHBOURS AND RELATIONS.</h3>


<p>In the morning, the inhabitants of the Vernonry
were to be seen a little before or after noon, according
to the season, appearing and disappearing in the
immediate neighbourhood of their house. It was
a little community perfectly at leisure, called out by
no work in the morning, returning with no more
punctuality than pleased them. As a matter of
fact they were exceedingly punctual, coming and
going as by clockwork, supporting their otherwise
limp existence by a severe mechanism of rule. Those
who have least to do, are often most rigorous in thus
measuring themselves out; it gives a certain sense
of something real in their lives. It was a little after
eleven when Mr. Mildmay Vernon appeared. His
residence was in the west wing, nearest to the pool
and the trees, and he thought it was probably owing
to the proximity of the water that his rheumatism
troubled him so much in winter. It did not trouble
him at this fine season, but he had the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
leaning on his stick and talking in a querulous voice.
He came out with his newspaper to a little summer-house
where the heat was tempered by the foliage
of a great lime. He had very good taste; he liked
the flicker of the sunshine which came through those
green-silken leaves, and the shelter was very grateful
when the sun was hot. The worst of it was
that the summer-house was not in his portion of the
common grounds, and the ladies, to whom it ought
to have belonged, and to whom it was so convenient
to do their work in, resented his constant presence.
In winter, he seated himself always on a sunny
bench which was in front of the windows now belonging
to Mrs. John, but she was not as yet aware
of this peculiarity. The Miss Vernon-Ridgways
occupied the space between Mr. Mildmay's house
and Mrs. John's. They were not in the direct line,
and they felt that they were treated accordingly,
the best of everything being appropriated to those
whom Catherine Vernon, who was so proud of her
name, considered nearest to the family stock. These
ladies were convinced that the blood of the Ridgways
had much enriched the liquid that meandered
through the veins of the Vernons; but in Catherine
Vernon's presence they kept silence as to this belief.
The rooms in the wings were much the best, they
thought, and they had even proposed an exchange
to Mr. Mildmay when he complained of being so close
to the pool. But he had only grinned and had not
accepted; he knew better. Of course he would
have grumbled if he had been lodged in Windsor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Castle, the ladies said; but he knew very well in
his heart that he had been preferred to the best
place. On the other side of the house, towards the
road, lived Mrs. Reginald Vernon, the young widow
of an officer, with her four children, of whom everybody
complained, and an old couple, in reality not
Vernons at all, but relations of Catherine's mother
who were looked down upon by the entire community,
and had clearly no business in the Vernonry.
The old gentleman, Captain Morgan, had been in
the navy, and therefore ought to have been the equal
of any one. But the people on the road side kept
themselves very much to themselves; the aristocracy
lived on the garden front. When Mrs. John Vernon
made her appearance in her deep mourning, there
was a great deal of excitement about the place.
Mr. Mildmay put down his paper and came out,
bowing, to the door of the summer-house.</p>

<p>"Between relations I do not know if any ceremony
of introduction is necessary," he said. "It
gives me great pleasure to welcome you back to
England. Poor John and I were once great friends.
I hope you will allow me to consider myself at once
an old acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Oh, how thankful I shall be for some one to
speak to!" cried Mrs. John. "Though my family
were of this county, I seem to have lost sight of
every one that used to know me. A great many
changes happen when one has been thirty years
away."</p>

<p>"Poor John! I suppose he never came back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
this country again?" Mr. Mildmay said, with
sympathetic curiosity, and that air of knowing all
about it which is sometimes so offensive; but
Mrs. John was simple-minded. She was not
even displeased by the undertone of confidential
understanding.</p>

<p>"Never! it would have broken his heart; what
was left to him to come for? He always said that
when ladies meddle with business everything goes
wrong. But, dear me, I oughtn't to say so here,"
Mrs. John added, with a little panic, looking round.</p>

<p>"Why?&mdash;you need not be afraid of expressing
your sentiments, my dear lady, before me. I have
the greatest respect for the ladies&mdash;where would we
without them? 'Oh, woman, in our hours of ease,'
&amp;c.&mdash;you know. But I think that mixed up with
business they are entirely out of their place. It
changes the natural relations&mdash;it creates a false
position&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John always thought so. But then I was so
silly&mdash;so dreadfully silly&mdash;about business; and he
thought that women should all be like me."</p>

<p>"That is certainly the kind of woman that is most
attractive to men," said Mr. Mildmay, with a gallant
bow; "and in my time ladies thought much of
that. I hope, however, that you will like this
retirement, and be happy here. It is very retired,
you see&mdash;nothing to disturb us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Mildmay, I dare say I shall do very
well," said Mrs. John, putting her handkerchief to
her eyes; "but seeing <i>that</i>" (she waved her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
towards the front of the White House in the
distance) "from the window, and knowing every
day how things are going on at the bank, and all
the old associations, I cannot be expected to be
very happy. That was not thought of when I
came here."</p>

<p>"My dear lady!" Mr. Mildmay said, soothingly;
and then he saw his way to inflicting another pin-prick
upon this bleeding heart so easily laid open
to him. "I suppose you know that Catherine has
put her nephew Harry and his sister&mdash;he is no more
her nephew than I am&mdash;one of Gilbert Vernon's
boys: but she took a fancy to him&mdash;in the White
House? It belongs to her now, like everything
else in the neighbourhood. Almost the whole of
Redborough is in her hands."</p>

<p>"Her nephew?" said Mrs. John, faintly, "but
she has no nephew&mdash;she was an only child. My
Hester is nearer to her than any one else." Then
she paused, and added with conscious magnanimity,
"Since I cannot have it, it doesn't matter to me
who has got it. We must make ourselves as
contented as we can&mdash;Hester and I."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the two ladies
appeared who considered the summer-house their
special property. They were tall women with
pronounced features and a continual smile&mdash;in
dresses which had a way of looking scanty, and
were exactly the same. Their necks were long and
their noses large, both which characteristics they
held to be evidences of family and condition. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
followed each other, one always a step in advance of
the other with a certain pose of their long necks
and turn of their shoulders which made some people
think of the flight of two long-necked birds. Mr.
Mildmay Vernon, who pretended to some scholarship,
called them the Cranes of Ibycus. They arrived
thus at the peaceful spot all chequered with morning
light and shade, as with a swoop of wings.</p>

<p>"Dear lady!" said Miss Matilda, "we should
have waited till we could make a formal call and
requested the pleasure of making your acquaintance
as we ought; but when we saw you in our summer-house,
we felt sure that you did not understand the
distribution of the place, and we hurried out to say
that we are delighted to see you in it, and <i>quite</i>
glad that you should use it as much as ever you
please."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Mrs. John, much disturbed, "I am
so sorry if I have intruded. I had not the least
idea&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> we were sure you had not&mdash;for everybody
knows that Mrs. John Vernon is a lady," said the
other. "It is awkward to have no one to introduce
us, but we must just introduce each other. Miss
Martha Vernon-Ridgway, Mrs. Vernon; and I am
Matilda," said the spokeswoman, with a curtsey.
"We are very glad to see you here."</p>

<p>At this Mrs. John made her curtsey too, but
being unready, found nothing to say: for she could
not be supposed to be glad to see them, as everybody
knew the sad circumstances in which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
returned to her former home: and she seated herself
again after her curtsey, wishing much that Hester
was with her. Hester had a happy knack of either
knowing or suggesting something to say.</p>

<p>"We hope you will find yourself comfortable,"
said the two ladies, who by dint of always beginning
to speak together had the air of making their
remarks in common; but Miss Matilda had better
wind and a firmer disposition than her sister, and
always carried the day. "You are lucky in having
the end house, which has all the fresh air. I
am sure we do not grudge you anything, but it
always makes us feel how we are boxed up; that is
our house between the wings. It is monotonous to
see nothing but the garden&mdash;but we don't complain."</p>

<p>"I am sure I am very sorry," Mrs. John began
to say.</p>

<p>"Your favourable opinion of the end houses is
very complimentary," said Mr. Mildmay. "I wish
it were founded on fact. My windows look into the
pool and draw all the miasma out of it. When I
have a fire I feel it come in. But I say nothing.
What would be the good of it? We are not here
only to please ourselves. Beggars should not be
choosers."</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Mildmay Vernon, that you will speak
for yourself," said the sisters. "We do not consider
that such an appellation applies to us. We are not
obliged, I beg to say," Miss Matilda added, "to live
anywhere that does not suit us. If we come here as
a favour to Catherine Vernon, who makes such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
point of having all her relations about her, it is not
that we are beggars, or anything of the sort."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear me!" said Mrs. John, clasping her
hands, "I hope nobody thinks that is the case. For
my poor dear husband's sake, and for Hester's sake,
I could never submit&mdash;; Catherine offered the house
out of kindness&mdash;nothing but that."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing but that," said Mr. Mildmay Vernon,
with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all but that," said the Miss Vernon-Ridgways.
"She said to us, I am sure, that it would
be a favour to herself&mdash;a personal favour. Don't you
remember, Martha? Nothing else would induce us,
as you may suppose, Mrs. John&mdash;my sister and me,
who have many friends and resources&mdash;to put up
with a little poky place&mdash;the worst, quite the worst,
here. But dear Catherine is very lonely. She is
not a person, you know, that can do with everybody.
You must understand her before you can get on with
her. Shouldn't you say so? And she is perhaps,
you know, a little too fond of her own way. People
who can't make allowances as relatives do, are apt
not to&mdash;like her, in short. And it is such a great
stand-by for her&mdash;such a comfort, to have us here."</p>

<p>"I should have thought she was very&mdash;independent,"
said Mrs. John, faltering a little. She did
not even venture to risk an opinion; but something
she was obliged to say. "But I can scarcely say I
know her," she added, anxiously, "for it is thirty
years since I was at Redborough, and people change
so much. She was young then."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Young! she must have been nearly forty. Her
character must have been what one may call formed
by that time," said Mr. Mildmay; "but I know
what you mean. Our dear Catherine whom we are
all so fond of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are quite right," said Miss Matilda, emphatically,
"<i>quite</i> right, though perhaps you mean
something different, for gentlemen are always so
strange. We <i>are</i> very fond of dear Catherine. All
the more that so many people misunderstand her,
and take wrong ideas. I think indeed that you
require to be a relation, to enter into the peculiarities
of the case, and take everything into
consideration, before you can do dear Catherine
justice. She is so good, but under such a <i>brusque</i>
exterior. Though she never <i>means</i> to hurt any one's
feelings&mdash;that I am certain of."</p>

<p>"Oh <i>never</i>!" cried Mr. Mildmay, with mock
enthusiasm, lifting up his hands and eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. John looked, as each spoke, from one to the
other with a great deal of perplexity. It had seemed
to her simple mind at first that it was with a real
enthusiasm that their general benefactress was being
discussed; but by this time she had begun to feel
the influence of the undertone. She was foolish,
but there was no rancour in her mind. So gentle a
little shaft as that which she had herself shot, in
vindication, as she thought of her husband, rather
than as assailing his successor, she might be capable
of; but systematic disparagement puzzled the poor
lady. She looked first at the Miss Vernon-Ridgways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and then at Mr. Mildmay Vernon, with a bewildered
look, trying to make out what they meant. And
then she was moved to make to the conversation a
contribution of her own&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am afraid my little girl made a sad mistake
last night," she said. "Catherine was so kind as
to come to see me&mdash;without ceremony&mdash;and I had
gone to bed."</p>

<p>"That was so like Catherine!" the Miss Vernon-Ridgways
cried. "Now anybody else would have
come next day at soonest to let you have time to
rest and get over your journey. But that is just
what she would be sure to do. Impatience is a
great defect in her character, it must be allowed.
She wanted you to be delighted, and to tell her how
beautiful everything was. It must be confessed it is
a little tiresome. You must praise everything, and
tell her you are <i>so</i> comfortable. One wouldn't like
it in anybody else."</p>

<p>"But what I regret so much," continued poor Mrs.
John, "is that Hester, my little girl, who had never
heard of Catherine&mdash;she is tall, but she is only
fourteen, and such a child! Don't you know she
would not let her in? I am afraid she was quite
rude to her."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. John's artless story was interrupted by
a series of little cheers from Mr. Mildmay, and titters
from the two sisters.</p>

<p>"Brava!" he said. "Well done!" taking away
Mrs. John's breath; while the two ladies uttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
little laughs and titterings, and exchanged glances
of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, how very funny!" they cried. "Oh, what
an amusing thing to happen! Dear Catherine, what
a snub for her! How I wish we had been there
to see."</p>

<p>"I should like to make acquaintance with your
little Hester, my dear lady," said Mr. Mildmay.
"She must have a fine spirit. Our respected Cousin
Catherine is only human, and we all feel that to
be opposed now and then would be for her moral
advantage. We flatter her ourselves, being grown-up
persons: but we like to know that she encounters
something now and then that will be for her good."</p>

<p>"I must again ask you to speak for yourself, Mr.
Mildmay," said the sisters; "flattery is not an art I
am acquainted with. Dear, dear, what a sad thing
for a beginning. How nervous it must have made
you! and knowing that dear Catherine, though she
is so generous, <i>cannot</i> forgive a jest. She has no
sense of humour; it is a great pity. She will not, I
fear, see the fun of it as we do."</p>

<p>"Do you think," said Mrs. John, with a little
tremor, "that she will be dreadfully angry? Hester
is such a child&mdash;and then, she didn't know."</p>

<p>The sisters both shook their heads upon their long
necks. They wished no particular harm to Mrs.
John; but they would not have been sorry so to
frighten her, as that she should go away as she came.
And they sincerely believed Catherine to be as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
represented her. Few people are capable of misrepresenting
goodness in the barefaced way of saying
one thing while they believe another. Most commonly
they have made out of shreds and patches of
observation and dislike, a fictitious figure meriting
all their anger and contempt, to which they attach
the unloved name. Catherine Vernon, according to
their picture of her, was a woman who, being richer
than they, helped them all with an ostentatious
benevolence, which was her justification for humiliating
them whenever she had a chance, and treating
them at all times as her inferiors and pensioners.
Perhaps they would themselves have done so in
Catherine Vernon's place. This at all events was
the way in which they had painted her to themselves.
They had grown to believe that she was all
this, and to expect her to act in accordance with the
character they had given her. When the sun shone
into the summer-house, and routed the little company,
which happened just about the time when the
meal which they called luncheon, but which to most
of them was dinner, was ready, Mrs. John carried
back with her to her new home a tremulous conviction
that any sort of vengeance was possible. She
might be turned out of this shelter, or she might be
made to feel that her life was a burden. And yet
when she got back to the low cool room in which
Hester, doubtful of Betsey's powers, was superintending
the laying out of the table, it seemed to
her, in the prospect of losing it, more desirable than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
it had been before. There were three windows in
deep recesses, one of them with a cheerful outlook
along the road that skirted the Common, in which
was placed a soft, luxurious chair, which was exactly
what Mrs. John liked. Nothing could have been
more grateful, coming out of the sunshine, than the
coolness of this brown room, with all the little
glimmers of light in the polished wainscot, and the
pretty old-fashioned furniture. Mrs. John sighed as
she placed herself in the chair at the window. And
the smell of the dish which Betsey soon after put
upon the table was very appetising. It turned out
to be nicely cooked, and the table was laid with fine
linen and pretty crystal and old-fashioned silver&mdash;everything
complete. The poor lady in her wandering
and unsettled life had lost almost all this needful
garniture which makes life so much more seemly
and smooth. She had been used to lodging-houses,
to <i>pensions</i>, greasy and public, to the vulgarity of
inns; and all this daintiness and freshness charmed
her with a sense of repose and personal property.
She could have cried to think that it might be put
in jeopardy by Hester's childish petulance.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did I let you persuade me to go to bed?
Why didn't I stay up&mdash;I could have done it quite
well&mdash;and seen Catherine Vernon? Why are you so
self-willed, child? I think I could be happy here,
at least as happy as I can ever be now; and what if
I must give it all up again for you?"</p>

<p>"Mother, if we have to give it up, we will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
better," said Hester, a little pale; "we shall get
pretty lodgings like Ruth Pinch, and I will give
lessons; and it will not matter about Cousin
Catherine."</p>

<p>"Oh, child, child, what do you know about it!"
Mrs. John said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>SETTLING DOWN.</h3>


<p>These alarms, however, did not come to anything,
and as the days passed on Mrs. John accustomed
herself to her new position and settled down to it
quietly. She got used to the little meetings in the
summer-house or on the bench in front of her own
windows, and soon learned to remark with the others
upon the freedom with which Mr. Mildmay Vernon
took the best place, not taking any trouble to remark
to whom it really belonged. He was a great advantage
to the ladies of the Vernonry in giving them
a subject upon which they could always be eloquent.
Even when they could not talk of it openly, they
would give each other little looks aside, with many
nods of the head and an occasional biting innuendo;
and this amused the ladies wonderfully, and kept
them perhaps now and then from criticising each
other, as such close neighbours could scarcely fail to
do. But even more interesting than Mr. Mildmay
Vernon and his mannish selfishness was Catherine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the universal subject on which they could fraternise
even with Mildmay Vernon himself. He was caustic,
and attacked her keenly; but the sisters never
failed to profess a great affection for their cousin,
declaring that from Catherine one accepted anything,
since one felt that it was only her <i>gauche</i> way
of doing things, or the fault of her education, but
that she always meant well. Dear Catherine! it
was such a pity, they said. Mrs. John never quite
adopted either style of remark, but the subject was
endless, and always afforded something to say; and
there was a little pleasure in hearing Catherine set
down from her superior place, even though a gentler
disposition and simpler mind prevented Mrs. John
herself from adding to the felicities of the discussion.
Catherine had taken no notice of the unlucky beginning
which had given so much alarm to Mrs. John,
and so much amusement to the other members of
the establishment. When she came in state to call
on the mourner, which she did a few days after, with
that amused toleration of the little weaknesses of her
dependents which was as natural in Catherine's
position as the eager and somewhat spiteful discussion
of her was in theirs, Miss Vernon had tapped
Hester on the cheek, and said, "This is the good
child who would not let me disturb her mother."
But when Mrs. John began to apologise and explain,
Catherine had stopped her, saying, "She was quite
right," with a decisive brevity, and turning to
another subject. The magnanimity of this would
have touched Hester's heart, but for the half-mocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
smile and air of amusement with which it was
said, and which made the girl much angrier than
before. It cannot be denied that this was to some
extent the tone unconsciously adopted by Catherine
in her dealings with the poor relations who were so
largely indebted to her bounty. There was a great
deal that was ridiculous in their little affectations
and discontents, and the half-resentment, half-exaction
with which they received her benefits.
These might have made her close her heart against
them, and turned her into a misanthrope; but
though the effect produced was different from this,
it was not perhaps more desirable. Catherine,
though she did not become misanthropical, became
cynical, in spite of herself. She tolerated everything,
and smiled at it; she became indulgent and
contemptuous. What did it matter what they said
or felt? If they learned to consider her gifts as
their right, if they comforted themselves in the
humiliation of receiving by mocking at the giver,
poor things, that was their misfortune&mdash;it did not
harm her upon her serene heights. She laughed at
Hester, tapping her cheek. Had she been perhaps
less tolerant, less easy to satisfy, she would not have
excited that burning sense of shame and resentment
in the girl's heart.</p>

<p>But Catherine was very kind. She came in the
afternoon in the carriage and took them out with
her for a drive, to the admiration of all beholders.
The Miss Vernon-Ridgways inspected this from
behind their curtains, and calculated how long it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
was since Catherine had shown such a civility to
themselves, and how soon Mrs. John would find out
the brief character of these attentions. And the
drive was perhaps not quite so successful as might
have been expected. Mrs. John indeed gave her
relative all the entertainment she could have
desired. She became tearful, and fell away altogether
into her pocket-handkerchief at almost every
turn of the road, saying, "Ah, how well I remember!"
then emerged from the cambric cloud,
and cheered up again till the next turn came, in a
way which would have afforded Catherine great
amusement but for the two blazing, indignant, angry
eyes of Hester fixed from the opposite side upon
her mother's foolish little pantomime and her
patroness's genial satisfaction, with equal fury, pain,
and penetration. Hester could not endure the
constant repetition of that outburst of pathos, the
smiles that would follow, the sudden relapse as her
mother was recalled by a new recollection to a sense
of what was necessary in her touching position; but
still less could she bear the lurking smile in Catherine
Vernon's eyes, and her inclination to draw the
poor lady out, sometimes even by a touch of what
Hester felt to be mock-sympathy. The girl could
scarcely contain herself as she drove along facing
these two ladies, seeing, even against her will, a
great deal which perhaps they themselves were only
half-conscious of. Oh, why would mother be so
silly! and Cousin Catherine, this rich woman who
had them all in her power, why had she not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
respect for weakness? Hester turned with an angry
longing to her idea of putting her own small young
figure between her mother and all those spurns and
scoffs, of carrying her away, and working for her,
and owing nothing to anybody.</p>

<p>When they stopped at the door of Kaley's, the
great shop of Redborough, and half-a-dozen obsequious
attendants started out to devote themselves
to the lightest suggestion of the great Miss Vernon,
Mrs. John cleared up, and enjoyed the reflected distinction
to the bottom of her heart; but Hester, pale
and furious, compelled to sit there as part of the
pageant, could scarcely keep still, and was within an
ace of jumping out of the carriage and dragging her
mother after her, so indignant was she, so humiliated.
Cousin Catherine threw a little <i>fichu</i> of black lace
into the girl's lap, with a careless, liberal, "You want
something for your neck, Hester," which the girl
would have thrown at her had she dared; and it
would not have taken much to wind her up to that
point of daring: but Mrs. John went home quite
pleased with her outing. "It was a melancholy
pleasure, to be sure," she said. "All those places
I used to know so well before you were born, Hester&mdash;and
Kaley's, where I used to spend so much
money. But, after all, it is a pleasure to come
back among the people that know you. Mr. Kaley
was so very civil; did you notice? I think he paid
more attention to me even than to Catherine; of
course he remembered that as long as I was well off
I always used to go there for everything. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
very sad, but I am glad to have done it. And then
Catherine was so kind. Let me see that pretty lace
thing she gave you? It is exactly what you wanted.
You must be sure to put it on when we go there to-morrow
to luncheon." Hester would have liked to
tear it in pieces and throw it in Miss Vernon's face;
but her mother regarded everything from a very
different point of view.</p>

<p>Catherine Vernon, on her side, talked a great deal
to Edward that evening of the comical scene, and
how she could not get the advantage of poor Mrs.
John's little <i>minauderies</i> because of that child with
her two big eyes. "I was afraid to stir for her. I
scarcely dared to say a word. I expected every
moment to be called to give an account of myself,"
she said. It added very much to her enjoyment of
all the humours of her life that she had this companion
to tell them to. He was her confidant, and
heard everything with the tenderest interest and a
great many amusing comments of his own. Certainly
in this one particular at least her desire to be
of use to her relations had met with a rich reward.
No son was ever more attentive to his mother: and
all his habits were so <i>nice</i> and good. A young man
who gets up to botanise in the morning, who will sit
at home at night, who has no evil inclinations&mdash;how
delightful he is to the female members of his family,
and with what applause and gratitude they repay
him for his goodness! And Miss Vernon felt the
force of that additional family bond which arises
from the fact that all the interests of the household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
different as their age and pursuits may be, are
the same. Nothing that concerned the one but
must have an interest for the other. Perhaps
Edward did not speak so much about himself, or
even about the business, which was naturally of the
first interest to her, as he might have done, but she
had scarcely as yet found this out: and certainly
he entered into all she told him on her side with
the most confidential fulness. "The Vernonry has
always been as good as a comedy," she said. "I
have to be so cautious not to offend them. And I
must be on my ps and qs with this little girl. There
is a great deal of fun to be got out of her; but we
must keep it strictly to ourselves."</p>

<p>"Oh, strictly!" said Edward, with a curious little
twist about the corners of his mouth. He had not
told the story of his own encounter with the new
subject of amusement, which was strange; but he
was a young man who kept his own counsel, having
his own fortune to make, as had been impressed
upon him from his birth.</p>

<p>There were only two other members of the Vernon
community with whom the strangers had not yet
made acquaintance (for as has been already said
Mrs. Reginald Vernon, the young widow who was
altogether wrapped up in her four children, and
old Captain and Mrs. Morgan on the west side of the
Vernonry scarcely counted at all), and these were
its gayest and most brilliant members, the present
dwellers in the White House, Harry and Ellen
Vernon, the most independent of all the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
community. Stories were current in it that Harry
in business matters had begun to set himself in
something like opposition to Catherine Vernon not
long after she had given up the conduct of the bank
into his hands: while Ellen detached herself openly
from her Aunt Catherine's court, and had set up a
sort of Princess of Wales's drawing-room of her own.
It was some time before they appeared at the
Vernonry, Harry driving his sister in a phaeton
with a pair of high-stepping horses which seemed
scarcely to touch the ground. The whole population
of the place was stirred by the appearance of this
brilliant equipage. Mrs. Reginald Vernon's little
boy, though bound under solemn penalties never
to enter the gardens, came round and hung upon
the gate to gaze. Even old Captain Morgan rose
from his window to take another look. Mr. Mildmay
Vernon came out with his newspaper in his hand,
and if the sisters did not appear, it was not from
want of curiosity but because Ellen Vernon had
not received their civilities when she came to
Redborough with the cordiality they had a right to
expect. Catherine Vernon's fine sleek horses made
no such impression as did this dashing pair. And
the pair who descended from the phaeton were as
dashing as their steeds. Ellen was very fair, with
hair half flaxen half golden, in light little curls like
a baby's upon her forehead, which was not the
fashion in those days and therefore much more
effective. She was dressed in a rich red-purple
gown, charitably supposed to be "second mourning"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
by the addition of a little lace and a black ribbon,
with yards of silken train sweeping after her, and
sweeping up too all the mats at the doors as she
went in. Harry was in the lightest of light clothes,
but he had a tiny hat-band supposed to answer all
necessities in the way of "respect" to John Vernon
deceased, or to John's widow living. Hester standing
shyly by, thought this new cousin Ellen the most
beautiful creature she had ever seen; her daintiness
and her fineness, her airy fairness of face, set off by
the rich colour of her dress, was dazzling as she
came into the brown room, with its two inhabitants
in mourning, and the tall, light-coloured young man
after her. Mrs. John made them her little curtsey,
shook hands with them, gave her greeting and a smile
or two, and then had recourse to her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, thanks," she said, "I have quite settled
down. I am very comfortable, but everything is so
changed. To go away from the White House where
I had everything I wished for, and then to come
back&mdash;here; it is a great difference."</p>

<p>"Oh, but this is so much nicer than the White
House," cried Ellen; "this is so delightfully old
fashioned! I would give the world to have the
Vernonry. If Aunt Catherine had only given it to
us when we came here and taken the White House
for the&mdash;&mdash;" pensioners she was about to say, but
paused in time&mdash;"other relations! I should have
liked it so much better, and probably so would
you."</p>

<p>Mrs. John shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never could have gone back to it in the same
circumstances," she said, "and therefore I would
prefer not to go to it at all."</p>

<p>"But oh, you must come and see me!" said
Ellen; "and you too," turning to Hester. "I am
so fond of getting among little girls and feeling
myself quite young again. Come and spend a long
day with me, won't you? I will show you all my
things, and Harry shall drive us out, if you like
driving. May she come? We have always something
going on. Aunt Catherine's is the old set,
and ours is the young set," she said with a laugh.
She spoke with a little accompaniment of chains
and bracelets, a soft jingle as of harness, about her,
being very lively and full of little gestures&mdash;pretty
bridlings of her head and movements of her hands.</p>

<p>Harry behind backed her up, as seemed to be
his duty.</p>

<p>"She is dreadfully wild," he said; "she would
like to be always on the go."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, nothing of the sort; but if we don't
enjoy ourselves when we are young, when are we to
do it? And then I say it is good policy, don't you
think so, Mrs. Vernon? You see we are just like
shopkeepers, all the people hereabouts are our
customers. And Aunt Catherine gives big dinners
for the old fogeys, but we do just as much good,
keeping the young ones jolly; and we keep ourselves
jolly too."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Miss Ellen," said Mrs. John, with some
dignity, "I never heard such an idea that bankers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
were like shopkeepers. Catherine must have made
great changes indeed if it is like that. It never was
so in my time."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Ellen, "you were too grand to allow it,
that is all, but it is the fashion now to speak plain."
And she laughed, and Harry laughed as if it had
been the best joke in the world. "But we mustn't
say so before Aunt Catherine," cried the gay young
woman. "She disapproves of us both as it is.
Perhaps not so much of Harry, for she likes the
boys best, you know; but oh, dreadfully of me!
If you want to keep in favour with Aunt Catherine&mdash;isn't
your name Hester?"</p>

<p>"I don't," said Hester, abruptly, without further
question.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, look here, here's another rebel! isn't
it fun? I thought you were nice from the very first
look of you," and here Ellen rose with a still greater
jingle of all her trappings and touched with her
own delicate fair cheek the darker oval of Hester's,
which coloured high with shyness and pleasure.
"I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll come for you one of
these days. Are you doing lessons now? What
are you learning? Oh, she may have a holiday for
one day?"</p>

<p>"That is just what I ought to be inquiring about,"
said Mrs. John. "A governess&mdash;I am afraid I am
not able to carry her on myself. I have taught
her," the poor lady said with pride, "all she
knows."</p>

<p>Hester listened with a gasp of astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
What Mrs. John meant was all she knew herself,
which was not much. And how about her teaching
and her independence and the <i>cours</i> she felt herself
ready to open? She was obliged to overcome her
shyness and explain herself.</p>

<p>"I don't want to learn," she said, "I want to
teach. I can speak French, and Italian, and German.
I want to open a <i>cours</i>; don't you think I might
open a <i>cours</i>? I know that I could teach, for I am
so fond of it, and I want something to do." Having
got all this out like a sudden shot from a gun,
Hester stopped short, got behind her mother, and
was heard no more.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Ellen, "teach! that little thing!"
and then she turned to her brother, "Isn't it fine?"
she said; "it would be a shame to stop her when
she wishes it. French and Italian and German,
only fancy. I don't know what a <i>cours</i> is, but
whatever it is you shall have it, dear. I promise
you. Certainly you shall have it. I will not have
you kept back for the want of that."</p>

<p>Hester was a great deal too much excited to laugh,
and here Mrs. John interfered. "You must excuse
me," she said, nervously. "Do not think I don't
feel the kindness. Oh, you must excuse me! I
could not let her teach. My poor husband would
never have suffered it for a moment. And what
would Catherine say?&mdash;a Vernon! Oh, no, no! it
is impossible; there is nothing I would not rather
do. She has spoken of it before: but I thought it
only childish nonsense. Oh, no, no! thank Heaven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
though we are poor," cried the poor lady, "and
fallen from what we were&mdash;we are not fallen so
far as that."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it isn't falling at all," said Ellen; "you
see you are old-fashioned. Don't be angry. I don't
mean any harm. But don't you know it is the
fashion now for girls to do something? Oh, but
it is though! the best girls do it; they paint, and
they do needlework, and they sing, and they write
little books, and everybody is proud to be able to
earn money. It is only when they are clever that
they can teach; and then they are so proud! Oh,
I assure you, Mrs. Vernon! I would not say so if it
were not quite the right thing. You know, Harry,
people do it in town constantly. Lady Mannion's
daughter mends old lace, and Mrs. Markham paints
things for the shops. It is the fashion; the very
best families do it. It will be quite aristocratic to
have a Vernon teaching. I shall take lessons myself."</p>

<p>"That's the thing," said the good-natured Harry.
"Nell, that's the best thing. She shall teach you
and me."</p>

<p>"Oh, he wants to make a hole-and-corner thing of
it," said Ellen, "to hide it up! How silly boys are!
when it is the very height of the fashion and will
bring us into notice directly! There is old Lady
Freeling will take her up at once: and the Duchess.
You may do whatever you please, but I will stand
by her. You may count upon me, Hester, I will
stand by you through thick and thin. You will be
quite a heroine: everybody will take you up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. John looked from one to the other aghast.
"Oh, no, no, pardon me; but Hester&mdash;I cannot
sanction it, I cannot sanction it; your poor papa&mdash;"
faltered Mrs. John.</p>

<p>It was characteristic that in the very midst of this
discussion Ellen Vernon got up with all the ringing
of her caparison, and took her leave, declaring that
she had forgotten that she had to go somewhere at
four o'clock, "and you know the horses will not
stand, Harry," she said, "but whenever we are happy
anywhere, we forget all our engagements&mdash;we are
two such sillies, Harry and I." She put her arm
round Hester's waist as they went through the
passage, and kissed her again at the door. "Mind,
you are to come and spend a long, long day with
me," she said. Mrs. John interrupted in the midst
of her remonstrances, and not sure that this dazzling
creature would not drive off straight somewhere or
other to establish Hester in her <i>cours</i>, followed after
them trying to put in another word. But Ellen had
been placed in her seat, and her dust-cloak arranged
round her, before the poor lady could say anything.
And she too stood spell-bound like all the rest, to
see the beautiful young couple in their grandeur, so
fair, so handsome, so perfectly got up. The only
fault that their severest critic could find with them
was that they were too fair; their very eyelashes
were flaxen, there were no contrasts in their smooth
fair faces; but this in conjunction with so much
youth and daintiness had a charm of its own. Mr.
Mildmay Vernon had been watching for them at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
window, losing all the good of his book, which was
from the circulating library and cost twopence a
night; consequently he threw away at least the half
of a farthing waiting for the young people to come
out. When they appeared again he went to his
door, taking off the soft old felt hat which he wore
habitually out of doors and in, and kissing his hand&mdash;not
it is to be feared very much to his advantage,
for these two fine young folks paid little attention to
their poor relations. The Miss Vernon-Ridgways
looked out behind their curtains watching closely.
How fine it is to be young and rich and beautiful
and on the top of the wave! With what admiration
all your dependents look upon you. Every one in
the Vernonry was breathless with excitement when
Harry took the reins and the groom left the horses'
heads, and the phaeton wheeled round. The little
boys at the gate scattered as it wheeled out, the
small Vernons vindicating their gentility and relationship
by standing straight in the way of the
horses. And with what a whirl and dash they
turned round the sweep of the road, and disappeared
from the longing view! Mildmay Vernon
who had taken such trouble to get a glance from
them crossed over to the door of the verandah where
Mrs. John, with the streamers of her cap blowing
about her, and her mind as much disturbed as her
capstrings, stood still breathless watching the departure.
"Well," he said, "so you've had the Prince
and Princess in all their grandeur." Mrs. John had
to take a moment to collect herself before she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
even make out what he had said. As for Hester,
she was so dazzled by this visit, her head and her
heart so beating and throbbing, that she was incapable
of putting up with the conversation which
always made her wicked. She ran away, leaving her
mother at the door, and flew to her own room to
recollect all that had passed, and to go over it again
and again as lovers do. She put her hands over her
eyes and lived over again that moment, and every
detail of Cousin Ellen's appearance and every word
she had said. The jingle of her chains and trinkets
seemed to Hester like silver bells, a pretty individualism
and sign of her presence. If she went
into a dark room or if you were blind, Hester
thought, you would know by that that it was she.
And the regal colour of her dress, and the black
lace of her bonnet all puffed about those wonderful
light locks, and her dainty shoes and her delicate
gloves, and everything about her! "A long, long
day," and "You may count upon me, Hester." Was
it possible that a creature so dazzling, so triumphant,
had spoken such words to her? Her heart was
more elated than it had ever been before in her
life. And as for the work which she had made up
her mind to do, for the first time it seemed possible
and feasible. Cousin Ellen would arrange it for her.
She was far too much excited and awed to be able
to laugh at the mistake Cousin Ellen had made in
her haste about buying a <i>cours</i> for Hester, not
knowing in the least what it meant. In this
way with all sincerity the dazzled worshippers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
greatness lose their perception of the ridiculous in
the persons of those who have seized upon their imaginations.
Hester would have been revolted and
angered had any one noted this ludicrous particular
in the conversation. Through the open window the
girl heard the voices of her mother and the neighbours,
now including the sharp voice of Miss Vernon-Ridgway,
and the sound made her heart rise with a
kind of indignant fury. They would discuss her as
if they had any understanding of such a creature, as
if they knew what they were speaking about! they,
old, poor, spiteful as they were, and she so beautiful,
so young, so splendid, and so kind. "The kindness
was the chief thing," Hester said to herself, putting
her fingers in her ears not to hear the ill-nature
down stairs. Oh, of course, they would be taking
her to pieces, pouring their gall upon her! Hester
felt that youth and happiness were on her own side
as against the envious and old and poor.</p>

<p>For days after she looked in vain for the reappearance
of that heavenly vision, every morning getting
up with the conviction that by noon at least it would
appear, every afternoon making up her mind that
the dulness of the lingering hours would be brightened
by the sound, the flash, the wind of rapid
movement, the same delightful voice, the perfumed
fair cheek, the jingle of the golden caparisons.
Every day Mrs. John said, first cheerfully, then
querulously, "I wonder if they will come for you to-day."
When it began to dawn upon Hester at last
that they were not coming, the sense of deception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
which came over her was, in some sort, like the
pangs of death. She stood still, in her very being
astounded, unable to understand what had happened.
They <i>were not coming again</i>. Her very heart stood
still, and all the wheels of her existence in a blank
pause like death. When they began to move again
reluctantly, hoarsely, Hester felt too sick and faint
for any conscious comment upon what had happened.
She could not bear the commentary which she was
almost forced to hear, and which she thought would
kill her&mdash;the "Poor child! so you've been expecting
Ellen Vernon?" which Miss Matilda next door said
to her with an insulting laugh, almost drove her
frantic. And not much less aggravating to the sensitive
girl were her mother's frequent wonderings
what could have become of them, whether Ellen could
be ill, what had happened. "They said they would
come and fetch you to spend a day with them,
didn't they? Then why don't they come, Hester?&mdash;why
don't they come?" the poor lady said.
Hester's anger and wretchedness and nervous irritation
were such that she could almost have struck
her mother. Was it right, in addition to her own
disappointment, that she should have this question
thrust upon her, and that all the pangs of
her first disenchantment should be discussed by contemptuous
spectators? This terrible experience,
which seemed to Hester to be branded upon her as
by red-hot irons, made a woman of her all at once.
To her own consciousness, at least, she was a child
no more.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3>NINETEEN.</h3>


<p>Such were the scenes and the people among whom
Hester Vernon grew up. Her first <i>d&eacute;sillusionment</i>
in respect to Cousin Ellen, who for one bright and
brief moment seemed about to bring glory to her
young existence, was very poignant and bitter: but
by the time Hester was nineteen she had ceased to
remember that there had been so sharp a sting in
it, and no longer felt it possible that Ellen, with all
her finery, could at any moment have affected her
with any particular sentiment. These years made a
great deal of difference in Hester. She was at the
same time younger and older at nineteen than at
fourteen. She was less self-confident, less sure of
her own powers to conduct everything, from her
mother&mdash;the most easily guided of all subject intelligences
in the old days&mdash;upwards to all human
circumstances, and even to life itself, which it had
seemed perfectly simple to the girl that she should
shape at her own pleasure. By degrees, as she grew
older, she found the futility of all these certainties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Her mother, who was so easily guided, slid back
again just as easily out of the groove into which her
child had, as she thought, fixed her, and circumstances
defied her altogether, taking their own way,
altogether uninfluenced by her wishes. Mrs. John
Vernon was like the "knotless thread" of the
Scotch proverb. Nothing could be more easy than
to convince her, to impress her ductile mind with
the sense of this or that duty; but, on the other
hand, nothing could be more easy than to undo
next moment all that had been done, and turn the
facile will in a new direction. Between this soft
and yielding foundation of her life upon which she
could find no firm footing, and the rock of Catherine
Vernon who remained quite immovable and uninfluenced
by her, coming no nearer as the years went
on, yet hemming in her steps and lessening her
freedom, the conditions of existence seemed all
against the high-spirited, ambitious, active-minded
and impatient girl, with her warm affections, and
quick intelligence, and hasty disposition. The people
immediately about were calculated to make her
despise her fellow-creatures altogether: the discontented
dependents who received everything without
a touch of human feeling, without gratitude or kindness,
and the always half-contemptuous patroness
who gave with not much more virtue, with a disdainful
magnanimity, asking nothing from her pensioners
but that they would amuse her with their follies&mdash;made
up a circle such as might have crushed the
goodness out of any young mind. Even had she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
herself begun with any enthusiasm for Catherine,
the situation would have been less terrible; but as
this, unfortunately, had not been the case, the poor
girl was delivered over to the contemplation of one
of the worst problems in human nature without
shield or safeguard, or any refuge to creep into.
Fortunately her youth, and the familiarity which
deadens all impression, kept her, as it keeps men in
general, from a conscious and naked encounter with
those facts which are fatal to all higher views or
natural charities. She had in her, however, by
nature only too strong a tendency to despise her
neighbours, and the Miss Vernon-Ridgways and Mr.
Mildmay Vernon were exactly of the order of beings
which a young adventurer upon life naturally treats
with disdain.</p>

<p>But Hester had something worse in her life than
even this feeling of contempt for the people about
her, bad as that is. She had the additional pang of
knowing that habit and temper often made her a
partaker of the odious sentiments which she loathed.
Sometimes she would be drawn into the talk of the
women who misrepresented their dear Catherine all
day long, and sneered bitterly at the very bounty
that supplied their wants. Sometimes she would
join involuntarily in the worse malignity of the man
to whom Catherine Vernon gave everything that was
good in his life, and who attributed every bad motive
to her. And as if that was not enough, Hester
sinned with Catherine too, and saw the ridicule
and the meanness of these miserable pensioners with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
a touch of the same cynicism which was the elder
woman's great defect, but was unpardonable in the
younger, to whom there should as yet have been no
loss of the ideal. The rage with which she would
contemplate herself when she yielded to the first
temptation and launched at Cousin Catherine in a
moment of passion one of those arrows which were
manufactured in the Vernonry, the deep disgust
which would fill her when she felt herself, like
Catherine, contemplating the world from a pinnacle
of irony, chill but smiling, swept her young spirit
like tempests. To grow at all in the midst of such
gales and whirlwinds was something. It was not
to be expected that she could grow otherwise than
contorted with the blasts. She came to the flower
and bloom of existence with a heart made to believe
and trust, yet warped to almost all around, and
finding no spot of honest standing-ground on which
to trust herself. Sometimes the young creature
would raise her head dismayed from one of the books
in which life is so different from what she found it,
and ask herself whether books were all lies, or whether
there was not to be found somewhere an existence
which was true? Sometimes she would stop short
in the midst of the Church services, or when she
said her prayers, to demand whether it was all
false, and these things invented only to make life
bearable? Was it worth living? she would ask
sometimes, with more reason than the essayists.
She could do nothing she wanted in it. Her <i>cours</i>
had all melted into thin air; if it had been possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
to get the consent of her authorities to the work
she had once felt herself so capable of, she was now
capable of it no longer. Her mother, obstinate in
nothing else, had been obstinate in this, that her
poor husband's daughter should not dishonour his
name (alack the day!) by becoming a teacher&mdash;a
teacher! like the poor governesses for whom he had
felt so much contempt; and Catherine Vernon, the
last auxiliary whom Mrs. John expected, had supported
her with a decision which put all struggles
out of the question. Catherine indeed had explained
herself on the occasion with a force which had almost
brought her within the range of Hester's sympathies,
notwithstanding that the decision was against herself.
"I am here," Miss Vernon had said, "to take care
of our family. The bank, and the money it brings
in, are not for me alone. I am ready to supply all
that is wanted, as reason directs, and I cannot give
my sanction to any members of the family descending
out of the position in which, by the hard work of
our forefathers, they were born. Women have never
worked for their living in our family, and, so far
as I can help it, they never shall."</p>

<p>"You did yourself, Cousin Catherine," said Hester,
who stood forth to learn her fate, looking up with
those large eyes, eager and penetrating, of which
Miss Vernon still stood in a certain awe.</p>

<p>"That was different. I did not stoop down to
paltry work. I took a place which&mdash;others had
abandoned. I was wanted to save the family, and
thank Heaven I could do it. For that, if you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
up to it, and occasion required, you should have
my permission to do anything. Keep the books, or
sweep the floors, what would it matter!"</p>

<p>"It would matter nothing to me," cried Hester,
clasping her nervous hands together; and then it
was that for a moment these two, the old woman
and the young woman, made of the same metal, with
the same defects and virtues, looked each other in
the eyes, and almost understood each other.</p>

<p>Almost, but, alas! not quite: Catherine's prejudices
against Mrs. John's daughter, and her adverse
experiences of mankind and womankind, especially
among the Vernons, intervened, and brought her
down suddenly from that high and serious ground
upon which Hester had been capable of understanding
her. She turned away with one of those
laughs, which still brought over the girl, in her
sensitive youthfulness, a blush which was like a
blaze of angry shame.</p>

<p>"No chance, I hope, of needing that a second
time: nor of turning for succour to you, my poor
girl."</p>

<p>It was not unkindly said, especially the latter part
of the sentence, though it ended in another laugh.
But Hester, who did not know the circumstances,
was quite unaware what that laugh meant. She did
not know that it was not only Catherine Vernon's
personal force and genius, but Catherine Vernon's
money, which had saved the bank. In the latter
point of view, of course, no succour could have been
had from Hester; and it was the impossibility of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
which made Miss Vernon laugh. But Hester thought
it was her readiness, her devotion, her power of doing
everything that mortal woman had ever done before
her, which was doubted, and the sense that she was
neither believed in nor understood swept in a wave
of bitterness through her heart. She was taken for
a mere schoolgirl, well-meaning perhaps&mdash;perhaps
not even that: incapable&mdash;she who felt herself
running over with capacity and strength, running to
waste. But she said nothing more. She retired,
carried further away from Catherine in the recoil,
from the manner of the approach to comprehending
her which she felt she had made. And after that
arrest of all her plans, Hester had ceased to struggle.
In a little while she was no longer capable of the
<i>cours</i> to which she had looked so eagerly. She did
not know anything else that she could do. She was
obliged to eat the bread of dependence, feeling
herself like all the rest, to the very heart ungrateful,
turning against the hand that bestowed it. There
was a little of Mrs. John's income left, enough,
Hester thought, to live upon in another place, where
she might have been free to eke out this little.
But at nineteen she was wiser than at fourteen, and
knew that to risk her mother's comfort, or to throw
the element of uncertainty again into her life, would
be at once unpardonable and impossible. She had
to yield, as most women have to do. She had to
consent to be bound by other people's rules, and to
put her hand to nothing that was unbecoming a
Vernon, a member of the reigning family. Small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
earnings by means of sketches, or china painting,
would have been as obnoxious to Catherine Vernon's
rule as the <i>cours</i>: and of what use would they have
been? It was not a little money that Hester wanted,
but work of which something good might come.
She yielded altogether, proudly, without another
word. The arrangement of the little household, the
needlework, and the housekeeping, were nothing
to her young capabilities; but she desisted from
the attempt to make something better of herself,
with an indignant yet sorrowful pride. Sometime
Catherine might find out what it was she had
rejected. This was the forlorn and bitter hope in
her heart.</p>

<p>The only element of comfort which Hester found
at this dark period of her life was in the other side
of the Heronry in the two despised households,
which the Miss Vernon-Ridgways and Mr. Mildmay
Vernon declared to be "not of our class." Mr.
Reginald Vernon's boys were always in mischief;
and Hester, who had something of the boy in her,
took to them with genuine fellow-feeling, and after
a while began to help them in their lessons (though
she knew nothing herself) with great effect. She
knew nothing herself; but a clear head, even without
much information, will easily make a path
through the middle of a schoolboy's lessons, which,
notwithstanding his Latin, he could not have found
out for himself. And Hester was "a dab at figures,"
the boys said, and found out their sums in a way
which was little short of miraculous. And there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
was a little sister who called forth all the tender
parts of Hester's nature, who had been a baby on
her first appearance at the Vernonry, and to whom
the girl would gladly have made herself nurse and
governess, and everything that girl could be. Little
Katie was as fond of Hester as of her mother, and
this was a wonderful solace to the heart of the girl,
who was a woman every inch of her, though she was
so much of a boy. Altogether the atmosphere was
better on that side of the establishment, the windows
looked on the Common, and the air was fresh and
large. And Mrs. Reginald, if she would have cared
for it, which was doubtful, had no time for gossip.
She did not pretend to be fond of Catherine, but she
was respectful and grateful, a new feeling altogether
to Hester. She was busy all day long, always
doing something, making clothes, mending stockings,
responding to all the thousand appeals of a set of
healthy, noisy children. The house was not so
orderly as it might be, and its aspect very different
from that of the refined gentility on the other side;
but the atmosphere was better, though sometimes
there was a flavour of boots in it, and in the afternoon
of tea. It was considered "just like the girl,"
that she should thus take to Mrs. Reginald, who had
been a poor clergyman's daughter, and was a Vernon
only by marriage. It showed what kind of stuff she
was made of.</p>

<p>"You should not let her spend her time there&mdash;a
mere nursery-maid of a woman. To think that
your daughter should have such tastes! But you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
should not let her, dear Mrs. John," the sisters
said.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> let her!" cried Mrs. John, throwing up her
hands; "I would not for the world say a word
against my own child, but Hester is more than I can
pretend to manage. She always was more than I
could manage. Her poor papa was the only one
that could do anything with her."</p>

<p>It was hard upon the girl when her own mother
gave her up; but this too was in Hester's day's
work; and she learned to smile at it, a little disdainfully,
as Catherine Vernon did; though she was
so little hardened in this way that her lips would
quiver in the middle of her smile.</p>

<p>The chief resource which Hester found on the
other side of the Vernonry was, however, still more
objectionable to the feelings of the genteel portion
of the little community, since it was in the other
little house that she found it, in the society of the
old people who were not Vernons at all, but who
quite unjustifiably as they all felt, being only her
mother's relations, were kept there by Catherine
Vernon, on the money of the family, the money
which was hers only in trust for the benefit of her
relations. They grudged Captain Morgan his home,
they grudged him his peaceful looks, they grudged
him the visits which Catherine was supposed to pay
oftener to him than to any one else in the Vernonry.
It is true that the Miss Vernon-Ridgways professed
to find Catherine's visits anything but desirable.</p>

<p>"Dear Catherine!" they said, "what a pity she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
has so little manner! When she is absent one can
recollect all her good qualities, how kind she really
is, you know, at bottom, and what a thing it is for
her to have us here, and how lonely she would be,
with her ways, if she had not us to fall back upon.
But when she is present, really you know it is a
struggle! Her manner is so against the poor, dear!
One is glad to see her go, to think, <i>that</i> is over; it
will be some time before she can come again; for
she really is much better, <i>far</i> better, than she
appears, poor dear Catherine!"</p>

<p>This was how they spoke of her: while Mr. Mildmay
shrugged his thin old shoulders. "Catherine,
poor thing, has too much the air of coming to see
if our houses are clean and our dinners simple
enough," he said.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. John chimed in to the general chorus,
though in her heart she was glad to see Catherine,
or any one. But they were all annoyed that she
should go so often to those old Morgans. They kept
an account of her calls, though they made believe
to dislike them, and when the carriage was heard on
the road (they could all distinguish the sound it
made from that of any other carriage), they all
calculated eagerly at what house she was due next.
And when, instead of coming in at the open gate,
which the old gardener made haste to open for her,
as if he had known her secrets and was aware of
her coming, she stayed outside, and drew up at the
Morgans, nobody could imagine what a commotion
there was. The sisters rushed in at once to Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
John, who had a window round the corner, and
watched to see if it was really true, and how long
Catherine stayed. They made remarks on the little
old gentleman, with his white head, when he came
out to put her into the carriage.</p>

<p>"What hypocrites some people are," they cried.
"We are always as civil as ever we can be, and I
hope dear Catherine, poor thing, <i>always</i> feels that
she is welcome. But to make believe that we have
enjoyed it is more than Martha or I am equal to."
They watched until the fat horses had turned round
and Catherine's bonnet was no longer distinguishable.
"That is the third time in a month, to my
certain knowledge," Miss Matilda would say.</p>

<p>"Be thankful, my dear ladies, that it is on old
Morgan, not on you, that she bestows her favours,"
Mr. Mildmay would remark.</p>

<p>Mrs. John was not always sure that she liked this
irruption into her house. But she too watched with
a little pique, and said that Catherine had a strange
taste.</p>

<p>"Oh, taste; dear Catherine! she has no <i>taste</i>!
Her worst enemy never accused of her <i>that</i>," the
other ladies cried.</p>

<p>And when it was known that these old Morgans,
the captain and his wife whom Catherine Vernon
distinguished in this way, had gained the heart of
Hester, the excitement in the Vernonry was tremendous.
Mr. Mildmay Vernon, though he was generally
very polite to her, turned upon his heel, when the
fact was made known to him, with angry contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I draw the line at the Morgans," he said. Much
might be forgiven to the young girl, the only youthful
creature (except Mrs. Reginald's boys, whom he
detested) among them, but not this.</p>

<p>The sisters did not, alas, pass it over so briefly.
They themselves had never taken any notice of the
old couple. The utmost they had done had been
to give the old captain a nod, as they did to the
tradesmen, when he took off his hat to them.
Mrs. Morgan, who never went out, did not come
in their way, fortunately for her. So strange was
this departure on Hester's part from all the traditions
of the place that, to do them justice, they
would not believe in her iniquity until the fullest
proof had been secured. But after she had been
seen about half a dozen times, at least, seated in the
round window which commanded the road, and was
the old gentleman's delight, and even, strange girl,
without any sense of shame, had made herself
visible to everybody walking with him on the edge
of the Common, and standing talking to him at his
door, there was no further possibility of doubt on
the subject. The only thing that could be thought
was to cut Hester, which was done accordingly by
all the garden front, even her own mother being
wound up by much exhortation, as for the advantage
of her daughter's soul, to maintain a studied
silence to the culprit by way of bringing her to her
senses. But it may be supposed that Mrs. John
did not hold out long. A more effectual means of
punishment than this was invented by Mr. Mildmay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Vernon, who declared that it was a very clever way
of currying favour with Catherine, and that he only
wondered it had never been adopted before. This,
indeed, touched Hester to the quick: but it did not
detach her from her friends. The objects of all this
enmity were two very simple old people without any
pretension at all, who were very willing to live peaceably
with all men. Captain Morgan was an old
sea-captain, with all the simplicity of homely wisdom
which so often characterises his class; and his wife
a gentle old woman, entirely devoted to him, and,
by this time, not capable of much more than to
keep the record of all his distinctions and to assert
his goodness. It was he who helped her down
stairs every day to the chimney corner in winter,
and in summer to the large chair in the window,
from which she could see everything that went on
in the road, all the people that passed, and the few
events that happened. A conviction that little Ted,
Mrs. Reginald's third boy, would be run over, and
an alarmed watch for that incident, were the only
things that disturbed her placid existence: and
that she could not accompany him on his walks was
her only regret.</p>

<p>"He dearly loves somebody to walk with," she
said: "except when he was at sea, my dear, I've
gone everywhere with him: and he misses me sadly.
Take a little turn with the captain, my dear."</p>

<p>And when Hester did that which so horrified the
other neighbours, old Mrs. Morgan looked out after
them from the window and saw the tall slim girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
walking by the side of the stooping old man, with
a pure delight that brought the tears to her eyes.
When you are over eighty it does not take much to
make you cry. Hester, who was the subject of continual
assault in every other place, was adored and
applauded in this little parlour, where they thought
her more beautiful, and good, and clever, than ever
girl had been before. The old captain, who was
screwed and twisted with rheumatism, and stooped
with age, held himself almost straight when his young
companion started with him upon his daily walk.</p>

<p>"When a young lady goes with me," he said, "I
must remember my manners. An old fellow gets
careless when he's left to himself."</p>

<p>And he told Hester stories of all the many-chaptered
past, of the long historic distances, which he could
remember like yesterday, and which seemed endless,
like an eternity, to her wondering eyes. He had
been in some of the old sea-fights of the heroic days&mdash;at
Trafalgar, though not in Nelson's ship; and he
liked nothing better than to fight his battles over
again. But it was not these warlike recollections
so much as the scraps of his more peaceful experience
which entranced the young listener. She liked
to hear him tell how he had "got hold" of a foolish
young middy or an able seaman who was "going to
the bad," or how he had subdued a threatening
mutiny, and calmed an excitement; and of the
many, many who had fallen around him, while he
kept on&mdash;fallen in death sometimes, fallen more
sadly in other ways. A whole world seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
open round Hester as he talked&mdash;a world more
serious, more large, than this, in which there were
only the paltry events of the day and her foolish
little troubles. In Captain Morgan's world there
were great storms and fights; there were dangers
and struggles, and death lurking round every corner.
She used to listen breathless, wondering at the difference&mdash;for
what danger was there, what chance of
mortal peril or temptation, here? In that other
universe the lives of hundreds of people would sometimes
hang upon the decision and promptitude, the
cool head and ready resource of one. Why was not
Hester born in that day? Why was not she a man?
But she did not sufficiently realise that when the
men were going through these perils, the mothers
and sisters were trembling at home, able to do no
more than she could. After these walks and talks,
she would go in with the captain to pour out his
tea, while Mrs. Morgan, in her big chair, restrained
herself and would not cry for pleasure as she was
so fain to do.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, it was a good wind that blew you
here," the old lady said. "The trouble it has been
to me not to be able to go about with him! Indoors
we are the best companions still; but he always
liked his walk, and it is dreadful not to be able to
go out with him. But he is happy when he has a
young companion like you."</p>

<p>Thus they made a princess of Hester, and attributed
to her every beautiful quality under the sun.
When a girl is not used to enthusiasm at home, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
does her good to have somebody believe in her and
admire all she is doing. And this was what made
her strong to bear all the jibes of the fine people, and
even that detestable suggestion that she meant to
curry favour with Catherine. Even the sting of this
did not move her to give up her old captain and her
humbler friends.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3>RECOLLECTIONS.</h3>


<p>"If you will not think me an old croaker, ma'am,
I would say that you retired from work too soon.
That was always my opinion. I said it at the time,
and I say it again. To give up before your time is
flying in the face of Providence."</p>

<p>"I know you are fond of a fine preacher, Mr.
Rule," said Catherine Vernon; "don't you remember
what the Scotch Chalmers said, that our lives were
like the work of creation, and that the last ten years
was the Sabbath&mdash;for rest?"</p>

<p>"We are not under the Jewish dispensation," said
the old clerk, as if that settled the question.</p>

<p>Catherine laughed. She was seated near old Mrs.
Morgan in the round window, her carriage waiting
outside. Mr. Rule, who was a neighbour, having
retired upon a handsome pension and occupying
a handsome house, had come in to call upon the old
couple, and these two, so long associated in labour
and anxiety, had begun, as was natural, to talk on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
a subject which the others with difficulty followed&mdash;the
bank. Mrs. Morgan never did anything save sit
contentedly in her chair with her hands clasped, but
the captain sat by the table working away at one
of his models of ships. He was very fond of making
these small craft, which were admirably rigged and
built like miniature men-of-war. This one was for
Alick Vernon, the middle boy of Mrs. Reginald's
three. In the background, half hidden by the curtains
and by the captain's seat, Hester had taken
refuge in a deep elbow-chair, and was reading. She
did not want to hide herself, but she had no desire
to be seen, and kept in the background of her own
will. Catherine Vernon never took any special
notice of her, and Hester was too proud either to
show that she felt this, or to make any attempt to
mend matters. She had risen up on her cousin's
entrance, and touched her hand coldly, then sank
back into her former place, and whether any one
remembered that she was there at all she did not
know.</p>

<p>"If one works till sixty, one does very well," Miss
Vernon said.</p>

<p>"You did not think that applicable to me, ma'am,"
said the clerk. "You would not let me give up
till I was near seventy."</p>

<p>"For the sake of the bank&mdash;for the sake of the
young men. Where would they have been without
a guide?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said old Rule, shaking his head, "there is
no guide like the chief. They might turn upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
me, and laugh in my face, and tell me I am old-fashioned;
but they could not say that to you."</p>

<p>"Well, well! the young men fortunately have
gone on very well, and have shown no need of a
guide."</p>

<p>To this there was no reply, but a little pause
pregnant of meaning. The thrill of the significance
in it roused Hester altogether from her book: she
had not been reading much to begin with, and now
all her faculties were awakened. She understood no
reason for it, but she understood <i>it</i>. Not so Catherine,
however, who took no notice, as so often
happens to the person chiefly concerned.</p>

<p>"Thirty years is a long spell," she said. "I was
at it late and early, and did not do so badly, though
I am only a woman."</p>

<p>"Women&mdash;when they do take to business&mdash;are
sometimes better then men," said the clerk, with an
accent almost of awe.</p>

<p>"That is natural," said old Captain Morgan over
his boat, without raising his head. "For why?&mdash;it
is not the common women, but those of the noble
kind, that ever think of trying: so of course they go
further and do better than the common men."</p>

<p>"I don't think that is a compliment," said Catherine,
"though it sounds a little like one. You have
a turn for those sort of sayings, Uncle Morgan, which
seem very sweet, but have a bitter wrapped up in
them."</p>

<p>"Nay, he never was bitter, Catherine," said the
old lady. "He knows what he is talking of. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
means no harm to the common women&mdash;for his wife
is one of them."</p>

<p>"We will not inquire too closely what he means,"
said Catherine Vernon with a smile. "Anyhow it
is very sweet to be able to retire while one has still
command of all one's faculties, and see the young
ones come in. Of course one does not expect to
live for ever. We are all in the Sunday period of
our lives, all of us here."</p>

<p>"Not I," said the old clerk, "with respect be it
spoken: I have had my Sunday and am ready to
begin again, if there should be any need of me."</p>

<p>"Which there is not, thank God," she said heartily.
And again there ensued that little pause. Was it
possible she did not observe it? No one echoed the
sentiment, no one even murmured the little nothings
with which a stillness, which has a meaning, is
generally filled up by some benevolent bystander.
What did it mean? Hester asked herself. But
Catherine took no notice. All had gone so well with
her. She was not afraid of evil tidings. Her
affection for the young men, her relations and
successors, was calm enough to secure her from the
anxious prescience of love. She took her life and
all that was connected with her, with that serene
and boundless faith which is the privilege of the
untried soul. Catherine would have resented beyond
everything else the imputation that her life was
without experience. She had gone through a great
deal, she thought. The evening long ago, when she
had been told that the credit of the Vernons was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
stake, and had roused herself to redeem it, had been
the highest crisis and turning-point of existence to
her. What had happened since had been little in
comparison. She had not known what anxiety meant
in the deepest sense of the word, and what had
happened before was so long over, that, though she
recollected every incident of that early time, it was
apart from all her after-life, and never influenced
her practical thoughts. She did not pay any attention
to that pause which might have awakened her
suspicions. There was no foundation in her for
suspicion to build upon. She was so sure of all connected
with her, and of herself, the first necessity
of all.</p>

<p>"I will never forget," said old Mr. Rule, after a
pause, "that night, when I had to go and warn you
that all was lost unless you would help. What a
night it was! I recollect now the light on Wilton
Street; the sunset shining in the Grange windows
as I rushed through the shrubbery. You were a
young lady then, Miss Vernon, and I could not tell
whether you would do it or not. Mrs. John, poor
thing, that I went to first, was never very wise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here a sudden fit of coughing on the part of the
captain, and a stirring of Hester in the background,
showed the old clerk his mistake.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Hester," he cried, "I
was just going to tell something of your mother that
would please you. When I told her we wanted
money, she ran to her desk and got out all she had.
It was twenty pounds," said the old clerk with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
little laugh; "twenty pounds, when we wanted twice
as many thousands! But what did that matter?
Some people have laughed when I have told that
story, and some have been nearer crying."</p>

<p>He was an old man, and tears and laughter get
mixed up at that age; he was nearly crying himself
at the end.</p>

<p>Hester's heart gave a bound of mingled pleasure
and pain. Perhaps even she had never done justice
to her simple-hearted mother. She sat bolt upright
in her chair, listening with all her might. Catherine
Vernon seemed to retire from the principal place she
had hitherto held in the conversation, and Hester
came forward in her stead. She looked at the old
clerk steadily.</p>

<p>"You speak," she said, "of ladies only. Where
was my father?" holding Rule with her eye, so that
he could not escape.</p>

<p>"Your father!" he faltered, his very lips quivering
with surprise and consternation.</p>

<p>"I don't know why we should bring up all these
old stories to-night," said Catherine, suddenly, "nor
what led us to introduce the subject. Let bygones
be bygones, Mr. Rule. We old fogeys have our little
talks together, and tell over our old adventures to
amuse ourselves for want of something better; but
that is what the young ones never understand."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to go away, Cousin Catherine?"
said Hester with her usual pale defiance, rising up
with the book in her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh no, not I. It does not matter in the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
whether you stay or go. I can remember, Uncle
Morgan, when the same sort of thing I am now
saying to Hester you used to say to me: and it does
not seem so very long ago either. Now we are all
old together, and not much difference between us,"
she said with a little laugh. It still gave her a
certain amusement to think that she was old like
these old people, and yet it was true; for though
sixty-five and eighty-five are very different, nobody
can doubt that sixty-five is old. It was still strange,
almost ludicrous, to Catherine, that it should
be so.</p>

<p>"I am of all ages," said the old captain, "for I can
remember all. I'll sail my boat with Alick to-morrow,
and enjoy it like a small boy (it's a capital
little boat, and will sail, I can tell you, Catherine, if
you took any interest in it), and then I shall walk on
the Common with a young lady, and talk of poetry
and love."</p>

<p>"Fie, captain!" said his old wife; "but he does
not mean all that nonsense, Hester."</p>

<p>"If love is nonsense, and poetry, she and I will go
to the stake for them," said the captain. "We'll take
a longer walk to-night, my dear, to prove to that old
woman how wrong she is."</p>

<p>"I can't wish you a pleasanter thing, captain&mdash;and
now I must be going," said old Rule, inconsequently.</p>

<p>Catherine, who had been sitting thoughtful since
the moment when she interfered, all unthanked and
misunderstood, to save Hester, rose when the old clerk
did, and went out before him, with her rich black silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
gown sweeping and rustling. The presence of the
elder people made her look blooming, and capable,
and young. The old couple watched her from their
window, as Rule, gratified and beaming, put her into
the carriage.</p>

<p>"She looks young enough to do as much again,"
said Captain Morgan, standing in the window with
his gum-bottle in his hands, with which he was
working.</p>

<p>"Oh, captain!" said his wife, "but where's the
money?" shaking her old head.</p>

<p>Hester behind peered out between these two aged
heads, pale with interest, and antagonism, and
attraction. She could never think of any one else
when Catherine was near, though all her instincts
were in arms against her. The words that passed
between the old people were as a foreign tongue to
her. She had not the slightest perception what they
meant.</p>

<p>Meantime Catherine spoke a warning word to her
former prime minister, who had abdicated later than
herself.</p>

<p>"You were very near giving that child a heartache,"
she said. "Take care not to say anything
before her. She need never know that her father
deserted his post. The creature has a quick sense of
honour, and it might wound her."</p>

<p>"She is not like his daughter," said the clerk,
"nor that poor lady's either. She is one of the pure
old Vernon stock."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Catherine, indifferently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
"I rather dislike her than otherwise; but I would
not do the child any harm." And then the fat horses
put themselves in motion, and she gave a smile and
a bow to all her retainers and worshippers&mdash;and the
Miss Vernon-Ridgways drew away from Mrs. John's
window, where as usual they had been watching
Catherine, as she, amid all these visible signs of her
wealth and sovereignty, disappeared from their eyes.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Captain Morgan," said Hester that
evening, when she walked out with him as usual,
"that Cousin Catherine was young once?"</p>

<p>It seemed an absurd question, but it was put with
the utmost gravity; and Hester knew what she
meant, as perhaps the reader will too.</p>

<p>"About your age, my dear," the captain said,
promptly, "and not at all unlike you."</p>

<p>"Like me!"</p>

<p>"You think you are very different now, but there
is not much more difference than that of years. She
was the same kind of girl as you are&mdash;masterful&mdash;very
sure that her own way was the right one&mdash;obstinate
as a mule in her mind, but not so difficult
to move by the heart."</p>

<p>"Am I all that?" said Hester, wondering; "not
in some things, for I am never sure that I am right&mdash;or
any one else&mdash;except you, perhaps. No, it is
the other way, quite the other way! I am very sure
that I am wrong, and every one else&mdash;except you."</p>

<p>"A large rule and a small exception," said the old
man; "but it is the same thing. Catherine was rich
and had everything her own way. You are&mdash;in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
midst of a poor community where we can have
nothing our own way. And at your age you can't
discriminate any more than she could at hers."</p>

<p>"Then does it come to this, that money is everything?"
asked the disciple with some bitterness, but
without, as may be supposed, the slightest intention
of accepting the master's teaching on this point.</p>

<p>Captain Morgan made no reply. What he said
was&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should like to interest you in Catherine, my
dear; all that happened, you know, before we came
here, while we were busy with our own life, my wife
and I; but I have put this and that together since.
Catherine was, as people say, crossed in love, notwithstanding
her wealth and all her qualities. So
far as I can make out, the man preferred a woman
that could not hold the candle to her; not so pretty,
not so clever, altogether inferior. That must be
rather a blow to a woman!"</p>

<p>"A blow! What sort of a woman would she be
that cared for a man who did not care for her?"</p>

<p>This somewhat inarticulate sentiment Hester
delivered with an indignant blush and flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>"That is all very fine, my dear; but you are too
clear-headed to be taken in by it," said the captain.
"A woman might not show it, perhaps. I have no
reason to suppose that Catherine showed it. But
you must remember that a woman is not a woman
in the abstract, but Catherine or Hester as the case
may be, and liable to everything that humanity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
liable to; and she would be a poor creature indeed
if she were incapable of falling in love generously,
as a man is supposed to do."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by generously!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but you do&mdash;none better. Something
however occurred after, much worse than his preference
of another woman. The man turned out to
be an unworthy man."</p>

<p>Hester had been following every word with
breathless interest. She grew quite pale, her lips
dropped apart, her eyes blazed out of the whiteness
of her face upon her old instructor. He went on
without taking note of this change,</p>

<p>"I should think for my part that there cannot be
any such blow as that. Don't you remember we
agreed it was the secret of all Hamlet's tragedy?
It is the tragedy of the world, my dear. I told the
old woman we were going to talk of love and poetry.
You see I was right."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Catherine?"</p>

<p>Hester was, as became a girl, far too much interested
in the individual case to be able to stray to
the abstract, and in fact she had only assented to
her mentor's theory in respect to Hamlet, not having
begun such investigations for herself.</p>

<p>"Ay, Catherine. Well, that is just what happened
to her, my dear. The man first showed that he had
no appreciation of herself, which we will allow must
have wounded her; and then after, when that was
all over, proved himself unworthy, dishonourable&mdash;in
short, what the young men call a cad."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was he?" asked Hester, in a low and
awe-stricken tone.</p>

<p>Then Captain Morgan turned to look at her, apparently
with some alarm; but his fears were quieted
by her face. She had evidently no clue to who it was.</p>

<p>"I never knew the man," he said quickly. "One
has no wish to know anything about him. The
interesting person is the woman in such a case.
Here, Hester, you must be the teacher. Tell me,
what would that discovery do to a girl, a daring,
masterful spirit like you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, captain, I am not daring or masterful,"
cried the girl clasping her hands; "don't you know
it is cruel to call me so&mdash;I that can do nothing, that
am only like a straw tossing on the water, carried the
way I would not. If I were masterful, I would go
away from here. I would do something for myself."</p>

<p>"All that is no answer to my question," the old
captain said.</p>

<p>Hester was used to follow his leading at a touch.
There was a kind of mesmerism in the effect he
had upon her.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," she said in a low and hurried
voice. "I don't see: it would turn all the world
wrong. It would&mdash;&mdash; But," she added, collecting
herself, "she would throw him away from her like a
dead thing. He would be dead. She would think
of him no more. Unworthy! One shakes one's
self free&mdash;one is done with that!"</p>

<p>"Look again," said the old man, with a half smile,
shaking his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't wish to look again. Is not that enough?
I suppose it would make her very unhappy. She
would struggle, she would try to find excuses. Oh,
Captain Morgan, don't press me so! I suppose everything
would turn round and round. There would
seem nothing to stand on, nothing to look up to,
the skies would all whirl and the solid ground.
It makes my head swim to think of it," the girl
cried, covering her eyes with her hands.</p>

<p>"That was how it was with Catherine, so far as I
know. She had to exert herself to save the bank,
and that saved her."</p>

<p>"Had he anything to do with the bank?" she
asked quickly.</p>

<p>"My dear, I tell you I was not here at the time,"
said the wary old man. "I had no knowledge of
the circumstances. I never wish to know who he
was, lest perhaps I should fail in charity towards
him. It is Catherine I want you to think of. The
bank troubles came afterwards, and she had to get
up and put her shoulder to the wheel, which saved
her. But do you think the world ever looked the
same after? Hamlet would never have discovered
what traitors those young courtiers were, if his
mother had not turned out a fraud, and his love a
delusion&mdash;at least that is my opinion. The wonder
is, he did not misdoubt Horatio too. That is what
I should have done if it had been me. But there is
the good of genius, Hester; the Master who knew
everything knew better. Catherine had a sort of
honest Horatio in old Rule, and she had that work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to do, which was the best thing for her. But you
may be sure the world was all dissolving views, and
nothing solid in it for years to come."</p>

<p>Hester, after the shock of the realisation which
had been forced upon her, as to what the result
of such a calamity would be, felt exhausted and
sick at heart, as if all her strength had been worn
out.</p>

<p>"Why did you want me to know this?" she said
at last. "I see no signs of it in her. She looks so
triumphant, as if nothing had ever happened or
could happen. She sees through everybody and
laughs at them, as if all their lies could never touch
her. Oh, she sees very well how they lie, but is
never angry, only laughs; is that the way to make
one love her? And she does not know the false
from the true," the girl cried with an access of
indignation. "She considers us all the same."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;no," said the old man, patting
her arm, but he did not press her any further. He
had said as much as he wanted to say. They went
further than usual over the Common as he had
threatened to his wife, and as they returned the
old captain owned himself fatigued and took
Hester's arm. "You must be my great-grandchild
in the spirit," he said. "We had a little girl once,
my wife and I. I have often fancied her grown up
and married and having children in her turn. Oh,
I am a great dreamer and an old fool. You remember
Elia's dream children, and then Tennyson,
though he was not old enough to know anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
about it, making the unborn faces shine beside the
never-lighted fire. These poets make fools of us all,
Hester. They know everything without any way to
know it. I fancy you are one of little Mary's grandchildren.
She must be as old as Catherine Vernon,
though age, we may suppose, doesn't count where
she is."</p>

<p>"You never told me about <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"There was nothing to tell," he said cheerfully.
"Her mother cries still if you speak of little Mary,
but not I. It would have been a great thing for us
if we could have kept her, but she would have
married I suppose, and her husband might not have
pleased me. I have thought of that. She would
have been taken in probably, and brought us some
man I could not put up with, though the children
might have been an addition. I dare say she would
have turned out a soft, innocent creature, taken in
all round, something like your mother, Hester. You
are tempted to despise that, you clever ones, but it
is a great mistake."</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Morgan, mother is taken in, as you
say, because she thinks everybody true&mdash;but she is
true always."</p>

<p>"<i>Always!</i>" said the old man with fervour, "and
far happier because she does not find it out. My
wife is the same. It is such souls as these that keep
the world steady. We should all tumble to pieces
if the race was made up of people like Catherine
Vernon and you."</p>

<p>"I wish you would not say Catherine Vernon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and me!" said Hester passionately; "there is no
likeness, none at all&mdash;none at all!"</p>

<p>But the old captain only laughed, and turned her
attention to the sunset, which was lighting up all
the western sky. The pines stood up against it like
rigid black shadows, cut out against the golden light
which was belted with flaming lines of crimson.
Overhead the sky ascended in varying tints of
daffodil and faint ethereal greenness up to the deep
yet bright summer blue. The last gleams caught
the yellow gorse upon the Common and turned every
blossom into gold, and all the peaks of the Vernonry
rose black against the radiance of the west.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the people <i>up there</i> have any hand
in it?" said the old man. "I should like to think
so. The old landscape painters, perhaps, that never
had such colours to work with before. But in that
case there would be nothing for me to do," he added
with a laugh, "unless it was some small post about
the gunneries. I was always fond of my guns."</p>

<p>To Hester this light suggestion, and the laugh
with which it was accompanied, sounded profane.
She shrank from anything which could take away
the awe and mystery from death, just as the old
man, who was so near the threshold, liked to
familiarise himself with the thought of going over
it, and still finding himself a recognisable creature
there.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3>A LOVER.</h3>


<p>It was about this time that Hester became aware
of a circumstance the most important that could
possibly happen in a young woman's life. There
had been no opportunity for her to become acquainted
with the emulations and rivalship of other
girls. Girls there were none about the Vernonry,
nor did they abound in the neighbourhood, in the
class from which alone her mother's visitors were
chosen. Mrs. John, it has been said, belonged to
a county family, a fact of which she was as proud as
it is natural and becoming a woman should be. She
did not altogether frown upon the few callers from
the town who thought it only their duty to Miss
Vernon, the most hospitable entertainer in the
neighbourhood, to take a little notice of the pensioners,
as the poor ladies at the Vernonry were
called; but she did not encourage these benevolent
visitors. "They are all ladies, and as good as any
of us," Mrs. Redfern had been heard to say, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the mayor's lady, and considered herself a leader of
society; and it was a beautiful sight to see Mrs.
John, in her old-fashioned dark room and simplest
black gown, receiving with kind condescension, and
endeavouring to set at her ease, this very fine lady,
who considered herself to be paying the poor widow
a quite undeserved honour. Mrs. John returned
cards only in acknowledgment of Mrs. Redfern's
visit, and there the acquaintance ended. So that
Hester lost altogether the opportunity of knowing
how ordinary girls looked and talked, and what was
the object of their ambition. She had not even,
which may surprise some people, come to any conclusion
whatever in respect to her own personal
appearance. Sometimes indeed, it cannot be denied,
she had looked up in the midst of a novel, where
all the young persons in whom the reader was
supposed to take any interest were beautiful, and
asked herself vaguely, with a blush, feeling ashamed
of the question, whether she was pretty. But partly
she was ashamed to give the time necessary to the
solution of the problem, and partly she had not the
data upon which to form her conclusions. There
was a beautiful girl in Redborough in a humble
position, upon whose claims everybody was agreed,
but she was a queenly creature, with dark hair
and blue eyes, and features of the most exquisite
regularity, to whom Hester could not flatter herself
that she bore the slightest resemblance. Nor was
she like Ellen Vernon, with her lovely fairness, her
look of wax and confectionary. Hester was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
ethereal at all. There was no smallness about her,
though she was slim as became her age. "The
springy motion in her gait," the swift, light step
which never tired, were beautiful in their way, and
so was the eager outlook in her eyes, which seemed
to contract and expand according to the degree of
interest with which outside subjects moved them;
but all this rather as exponents of the mind within
than as merely physical features. Her hair had
never grown long, not much longer indeed than was
just necessary to twist into the knot behind which
proved her to be grown up, and it remained full of
curl and ready to break the smoothness of outline
then thought necessary, on the smallest provocation.
Her complexion was very variable, sometimes radiant
with flutters of sudden colour, sometimes relapsing
into a rose-tinted whiteness, more white than pale.
Her features were not much to brag of; it was the
play of prompt feeling in her face, the interest, the
indignation, the pity, the perpetual change and
vicissitude, that made it attractive, and on this
point of course Hester could not judge. Seeing
that her mouth was too large, and her nose too
short, and her eyebrows too marked, she concluded
that she was not pretty, and regretted it, though in
her circumstances it mattered very little; her friends
liked her just as well, whether or not; and she was
never likely to produce the effect which the heroines
in novels&mdash;even though comparatively plain&mdash;did
produce. So she decided, with a little shame to
think that she could have been disturbed about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
matter, that it was not worth going into it further.
All the same it is a pity, for the sake of young
readers, that all the girls in novels, with so very
rare exceptions&mdash;and Jane Eyre, if not pretty,
probably was less plain than she thought, and certainly
was <i>aga&ccedil;ante</i>, which is much more effective&mdash;should
be beautiful and should have so much
admiration and conquest. The girls who read are
apt to wonder how it is that they have not the same
fortune. Hester, for her part, had a fine scorn of
feminine victories in this sort; they had never come
within the possibilities of her lot. She never went
to balls, nor met in society gangs of suitors contending
for her smile; she did not believe in such
things, and she thought she despised them.</p>

<p>It was in the very midst of this scepticism that
she suddenly became aware of certain facts which,
as we have said, were of the kind generally supposed
to be most important in a young woman's life.
Harry Vernon had been for some time alone in the
splendour of the White House; Ellen, who had
inflicted so deep a wound upon Hester's inexperienced
girlhood, had married the previous summer,
and in the lack of young ladies worthy to swell her
train on that occasion, had selected Hester as one of
her bridesmaids. Hester had never forgiven her
frivolous kinswoman for that first disenchantment
of her youth, but her mother, upon whom her
exclusion from society and from all opportunities of
distinguishing herself there weighed heavily, had
insisted on the acceptance of the invitation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Hester had figured accordingly in a white muslin
frock, much too simple to match the toilette of the
other bridesmaids in the pageant, greatly to her own
disquiet. She was the only Vernon in it, and thus
had been specially put forward, and Ellen, altogether
unconscious of previous offence, had exhausted herself
in demonstrations of affection to her young
relative. It was she whom Harry led out in the
morning's procession, and he had, in the intervals
of his duty to his guests, come back again and again
to her side. Hester, all inexperienced and unknowing,
had paid little attention to these early indications.
She did not identify him with his sister's
guilt towards her. He was a weak, good-natured,
genial fellow, and no more. If Harry did anything
wrong, no doubt it was because of being led astray.
In himself he wished nothing but good to any one.
He was not clever, he was steady and stolid, and
went through both work and pleasure without much
discrimination as to which was which, carrying on
both in the same way. When he began to come
to the Vernonry evening after evening, Hester paid
little attention to him. She would go out to walk
with old Captain Morgan in the very face of the
young visitor whose "intentions" all the community
considered to be of such importance. Hester never
thought of his "intentions." She had none herself
in which he was anyhow involved. She was perfectly
friendly when they met, but she did not care
whether they ever met or not, and repulsed him as
much as steady indifference can repulse an obstinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and not very clear-sighted young man. But this
was not saying much. Harry knew as well as any
one that his suit was a wonderful chance for his
distant cousin; that Hester had no right to look for
such good fortune as that of being the object of his
affections. He knew that he was bringing in his
hand everything a girl need wish for. And so far
as Hester's course of action was concerned, though
he was much irritated by it sometimes, he still felt
that it was what she had a right to employ in the
circumstances. It "drew a fellow on;" she was right
to do what she could to obtain this so desirable
consummation. He could not find fault with her
even when he was angry. Had she been too ready
to meet him, he felt that he would himself have
despised what was so easily won. But her coyness,
her apparent indifference, her walking out to the
old captain from her lover, all helped to rivet his
chains. It was excellent policy, and he took it as
such; it drew a fellow on.</p>

<p>And it would be impossible to describe the interest
of the Vernonry in this new development. Harry
made his appearance first when they were all outside
enjoying the beauty of the summer evening,
Mr. Mildmay Vernon occupying that bench in front
of the verandah, which was the most desirable place
in the evening, being just clear of the low sunbeams
which came into your eyes through the trunks of
the pines, penetrating like golden arrows. Mrs.
John herself was watering the plants in the verandah,
which were a little exhausted by the long, scorching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
day, and wanted refreshment. The Miss Vernon-Ridgways
were walking about with their long sashes
extended and their large sleeves flying, the one
eagerly talking from a few paces behind her, to the
other. Their conversation was on the well-worn
subject of "some people who never knew their own
place," and was aimed at the tranquil gentleman on
the bench, who when he had secured his own comfort,
which was the first thing to be thought of,
rather prided himself upon never interfering with
his neighbours. When Harry Vernon appeared,
there was a universal stir. The sisters made a little
flight round him, gazing at him. "I do believe it
is Harry. Is it Harry?" they said. Mr. Mildmay
Vernon put down his paper in the midst of a paragraph,
and came forward with his most genial air.
"I hope this is a visit only. I hope there is nothing
wrong," he said.</p>

<p>"Wrong! what should be wrong?" said Harry,
turning his fair countenance wonderingly upon the
group. "It's a lovely evening, and I wanted a walk,"
he added, with a little reddening of that too fair
face; "and besides, I've got a message from Ellen
to Mrs. John&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear Ellen! How is Ellen? When is she
coming home?" cried Miss Matilda. "When you
write to her, give her our love. But I suppose she
is too happy to care about anybody's love save one
person's. Marriage will improve Ellen&mdash;marriage
will steady her. She used to be a little forgetful,
perhaps. Ah! marriage will do her a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of good. She had everything too much her own
way."</p>

<p>"But she is missed. It would be pretty to see her
again&mdash;forgetting," said Mr. Mildmay, "that she had
ever set eyes on you before."</p>

<p>"Ah, dear Ellen! We should not have known
her without her little ways!"</p>

<p>Now Harry was fond of his sister.</p>

<p>"I'll thank you to leave Ellen alone," he said,
brusquely. "I dare say we've all got our little ways.
I had something to say to Mrs. John if you'll let
me pass, please."</p>

<p>"Politeness is characteristic of our family," said
Miss Matilda, drawing her skirts closely round her,
and standing ostentatiously, though she was not very
near him, out of his way.</p>

<p>Mrs. John stood looking on in the verandah with
the watering-can in her hand, not hearing much of
what they said, but feeling that it was uncivil, and
putting on a little deprecating, anxious smile&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come in," she said, "come in. The parlour, I
think, is almost cooler than the garden after this hot
day. Shall I make you a cup of tea?"</p>

<p>"These pensioners of Aunt Catherine's are odious
people," said Harry. "It was you and Hester I came
to see."</p>

<p>"You must not speak of them so&mdash;they would not
like it," said Mrs. John, not thinking that she herself
might be spoken of in the same way, though rather
pleased at the bottom of her heart that Harry should
make a distinction between them. He threw himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
down in a chair, which creaked under his weight,
and looked very large and mannish in the little
feminine room&mdash;rather, indeed, it must be allowed,
out of place there.</p>

<p>"I wonder how you can get on in such a poky
little place," he said. "I should like to see you in
handsome big rooms; it would seem much more
natural."</p>

<p>Mrs. John smiled again, a deprecating, half-apologetic
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am very glad to be here. I did not expect
ever to have to live in such a poor place when I
married, it is true; but people's minds change with
their circumstances. I am glad to have it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to&mdash;you should have been provided
for in a different way. Ah, Hester! I am so glad to
see you," Harry said, rising with some commotion to
his feet. He took Hester's hand and held it for a
moment. "I thought I'd come and tell you about
Ellen," he said, with a blush.</p>

<p>"Hester," said her mother, giving her a little
meaning look, of which she did not understand the
signification, "you must give Mr. Harry a cup of tea."</p>

<p>And there he sat, to her great oppression, for an
hour at least. He did not even tell them about Ellen.
He said nothing in particular&mdash;nothing which it
was necessary to say. Hester, who had intended
to go out with her old captain, felt herself bound by
politeness and her mother's warning looks. She did
not know what these looks meant, but they held her
fast. There was not very much conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
He said a few things over and over, which made it
difficult to change the subject; and it was mostly
Mrs. John who replied, and who rather liked, also,
to repeat the same sentiment. Hester poured out
the tea, and when the moment came for that,
lighted the candles, and sat down in the background
and took her work. She was not very fond of work,
but it was better than doing nothing at all. When
she took that seat which was beyond his point of
vision, Harry turned his chair round so as to face
her, and took up one of the candles and arranged it
for her, that she might see to work. "You should
have a lamp," he said. "I have a nice little lamp at
home just the thing for you; you must let me send
it." What a long time he sat, and how anxious he
was to make himself agreeable! After that he came
three or four times in succession. Mrs. John began
to look for him, brightening up as the hour of his
visit approached; and the neighbours kept up a
watch which it was impossible to mistake. "If he
comes to-night again I shall know what to think,"
Miss Matilda said. But when he came that night he
met Hester at the gate in her out-door apparel.
Harry's countenance fell.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are surely not going out," he said, "not
just when I come? You couldn't be so unkind."</p>

<p>"I have been unkind to Captain Morgan very
often," said Hester. "I must not neglect him to-night,"
and she passed him quickly with a little bow
and smile. It made Harry very angry, but still he
felt that it drew a fellow on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>On one of these occasions, when Hester eluded
him in this way, Harry spoke his mind to Mrs. John.</p>

<p>"I'm very lonely up there by myself," he said,
"and I have nobody to please but myself. Ellen
used to interfere and keep me in order, as she said;
but now she's got somebody else to look after. I've
thought a great deal of Hester for years back. That
time when we came to see you first, you know, when
Ellen made so many advances and forgot all about
them&mdash;that was her way. She's not a bad sort when
you get safe hold of her&mdash;but it's her way. Well,
from that time I've thought of Hester, though I
never liked to say a word as long as Ellen was
there."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Harry," said Mrs. John, who was
fluttered and flattered as if a proposal were being
made to herself. "She was only a child in those
days."</p>

<p>"I know; but she isn't a child now. If she'll
have me&mdash;and I can't see why she shouldn't have me&mdash;we
might all make each other very comfortable.
I'm not frightened of a mother-in-law as so many
fellows are. I believe that's all bosh. I shouldn't
wish to part you more than for the honeymoon, you
know. There is plenty of room for you in the White
House, and it would be always nice for her to have
you there, when I happened to be engaged. I think
we should hit it off very well together. And as for
money&mdash;I know she has no money&mdash;I should never
think twice about that. Of course it would be to my
own advantage to make as good settlements as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
possible, which is always a good thing in business
when one never knows what may happen. We might
have to consult Aunt Catherine just at first, for she
always keeps a hold on the funds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And there's Hester to consult&mdash;that is the most
important," said Mrs. John.</p>

<p>"To be sure, that's the most important; but I
can't see why she should object," said Harry. "Why,
she has never seen any one, has she? I am the only
man that has paid any attention to her. At Ellen's
wedding there were one or two, and that was only
once in a way. I don't say she likes me, but she
can't like any one else, can she? for she has never
seen anybody."</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," said Mrs. John; "but, Mr.
Harry, girls are so fanciful. You cannot be sure of
them in that way. They may have some ideal in
their heads, though they have never met any
one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said Harry, making a large mouthful of
the word, and opening wide those blue eyes of his
with the light lashes. And, indeed, he did not
know much about that sort of thing. He returned
to the question without paying any attention to this
strange piece of nonsense. "There's nobody about
but the old gentlemen, and Ned at Aunt Catherine's.
Sometimes I've felt a little suspicious of
Ned. Does he come and see you often? He is a
great fellow for books and that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Mr. Edward Vernon," said Mrs. John, a little
stiffly, "<i>never</i> comes here. Hester, I believe has met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
him at the Grange or elsewhere; but he never comes
here. I scarcely know him, neither of course does
she."</p>

<p>"Then," said Harry, taking no notice of the offence
in her tone, but bringing down his hand vehemently
upon his knee, "if it isn't Ned, there is no one she
can have seen, and the field is all clear for me."</p>

<p>"That is very true," said Hester's mother, but her
tone was doubtful. "At the same time," she continued,
"perhaps it would be well to let me talk to
her a little first, Mr. Harry, just to see, before you
said anything."</p>

<p>"If she doesn't want to have me, I don't wish to
force her to have me," said Harry, his pride taking
alarm.</p>

<p>"Force&mdash;oh, Mr. Harry, do you think I would
force my child? And indeed I couldn't;" cried Mrs.
John, shaking her head. "She is far, far stronger
than I."</p>

<p>"She would be the cleverest of us all," said Harry
admiringly. "I believe she is as clever as Aunt
Catherine. I dare say she might even find out
dodges in the bank, like Aunt Catherine did. Perhaps
on the whole it might be better if you would
sound her a bit, eh? and find out what she is up to.
What she thinks of me, for instance," said Harry,
nodding half with modesty, half with vanity. "Yes,
I should like that. I should like to be pretty sure
before I committed myself. A man doesn't like to
make a fool of himself for nothing," the young man
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. John thought it was quite natural. And
indeed all her feelings were enlisted on Harry's side,
who expressed himself so beautifully. What better
could happen to Hester than to be thus uplifted to
the heights of luxury and wealth, the White House,
and everything else that heart could desire, with a
nice husband, so good-looking, so tall, so fair, and so
anxious to be kind to her mother? Her imagination,
not her strong point on ordinary occasions, was
strong enough on this, to jump at all the advantages
of the match with a rapidity which would not have
disgraced Hester herself. To see her child the
mistress of the White House was the very height of
Mrs. John's ambition. She did not feel that the
world held anything more desirable. Her mind
made a hurried rush through the rooms, all so
familiar to her, and which Harry, no doubt, would
re-model in preparation for his bride. With what
pride and happiness would she see her child at the
head of the table, where she herself had once sat!
It would be a return more triumphant than any
return in her own person. And yet she would be
there too, the happy spectator, the witness of it all.
She saw in her mind's eye, the wedding, the beautiful
clothes, the phaeton, and the high-stepping
horses, and perhaps a pony carriage which Hester
herself would drive. All this in a moment, while
Harry was telling her that he would like to be pretty
sure before he committed himself. Perhaps it was
not a lofty sentiment, but she felt it to be quite
natural. A man with so much to bestow had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
right to see his way before him, and then for Hester's
own sake it was far better that she should not be
taken by surprise. She was a perverse girl, and if
the young man walked straight up to her without
warning, and asked her to marry him, the chances
were that she would refuse. That was not a risk to
be run when so much was at stake.</p>

<p>"If you will leave it in my hands, I think you
will have no cause to regret it," she said, nodding
her head at him with the softest maternal smile.
"You may be sure you will have my good wishes."</p>

<p>They were both quite affected when he took his
leave.</p>

<p>"I feel sure we should hit it off together," Harry
said, warmly grasping her hand; and the water stood
in her eyes. She could almost have given him a kiss
as he stood before her, a little flushed and agitated
with his self-revelation. Indeed, she would have
done so but for that doubt about Hester. What
would Hester say? That was the one point upon
which doubt existed, and unfortunately it was the
most important of all. There could not be the least
uncertainty as to the many advantages of the
match; money, comfort, good position, good connection,
everything that can be wished for in
marriage, and with no personal defects to be glossed
over by these advantages, but a fine young man, a
husband any girl might be proud of. Elation and
gladness filled Mrs. John's heart, when she contemplated
that side of the question; but when she
turned to the other a chill came over her, a cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
that swallowed up the sunshine. What would
Hester say? Oh the perverseness of girls that
never know what is good for them! If it had been
somebody quite ineligible, somebody without a
penny, the chances were that Hester would have had
no doubt on the subject. Mrs. John could not
remain still after this momentous conversation. She
went from one window to another, looking out,
watching for her daughter's return. She had been
vexed that Hester should have been so uncivil as to
go away for no better reason than to walk with old
Captain Morgan when Harry was coming, but she
felt now that this contradictoriness on the girl's part
had been providential. How full her head was with
thoughts and plans how to speak, and what to say, with
artful approaches to the subject, and innocent wiles
by which to divert all suspicion, and lead Hester
unawares towards that goal! She trotted up stairs
and down, from one window to another, framing
dialogue after dialogue in her mind. She was
astonished by her own powers as she did so. If she
ever had been so clever in reality as she was in this
sudden crisis of imagination, she felt that it might
have made a difference in her whole life. And one
thing Mrs. John had the wisdom and goodness to do
in the midst of her excitement, she kept within her
own house, and did not so much as venture down to
the verandah, where she might have been seen from
outside, and pounced upon by the eager watchers,
brimful of curiosity, who wanted to know what it all
meant. Miss Matilda Vernon-Ridgway, as has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
intimated, had been conscious of an internal admonition
that something critical, something decisive,
something throwing a distinct light upon the "intentions"
of young Harry would happen this night.
And Mrs. John knew herself, and was aware that
she never would be able to stand against the questionings
of these curious spectators. Her only safety
was in keeping out of their way. Thus not only
her imaginations, but her moral faculties, her power
of self-control and self-denial, were strengthened by
the occurrences of this momentous evening. She
had not felt so important before since Hester was
born.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3>MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.</h3>


<p>Mrs. John had a long time to wait. The old
captain prolonged his walk, as he was too apt to do,
beyond his strength, and came home very slowly,
leaning on Hester's arm; and then as every hindrance,
when people are anxious, has a way of
doubling itself, Mrs. Morgan sent a polite message
to say that she hoped Mrs. John Vernon would not
object if she kept Hester to supper. Mrs. John
objected greatly, but she was weak, and had never
set up her own will in the face of any one else who
made a stand for theirs. She said "Oh yes, with
pleasure," with a pitiful little smile to Mrs. Morgan's
maid. To deny Hester anything (except the power of
making a governess of herself and losing caste) was
what she had never done in her life. It always gave
her a little pang when her child left her to eat her
solitary meal in the dark little parlour which nothing
would light up, but she had trained herself to feel
that this was very wrong, and that young people need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
change. Hester was entirely unacquainted with the
series of little sacrifices which her mother thus made
for her. If she thought of them at all, she thought
that the poor lady "did not mind." Her old friends
next door were not gay, but they talked as Mrs. John
was quite incapable of talking, and lived, though
they saw nobody, in a wider atmosphere, a bigger
world than any of the others. The old captain's
stories, the people he had seen, the experiences both
these old people had gone through, were like another
world to Hester. Her mother was small and straitened,
had seen without seeing, and lived without
living. In the days when Hester had guided her
about by the arm, taking her whither she pleased,
making new eyes for her in the vividness of her own,
it was enough for the girl to have that echo of all
her sentiments, that little objection generally ending
with agreement, that broken little stream of faint
recollections which her mother would give forth.
But Hester had long ceased to form part of that
sort of dual being which is so often made by a
mother and her only daughter. To feel your parent
smaller and sillier than yourself is sad. A great
many young people do it without any adequate
reason, strong in their sense of being the reigning
monarchs of the present, while their progenitors
belong to the past. Perhaps indeed it is the nature
of youth to take a pleasure in such superiority.
But that is very different from the fact of actual
incapacity on the mother's part to follow her child's
thoughts or even to know what she meant. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
John was very well aware of it herself, and declared
with a smiling countenance that young people liked
change, and that she was never so happy as when
her child was enjoying herself. And Hester, though
she was so much more clever, accepted all this, and
believed and thought her mother was quite contented
with the evening paper, or a book from the
circulating library, and never missed her when she
was away. She misunderstood her silly mother, far
more than that silly mother did her. The lesser
comprehended the bigger, not the bigger the lesser,
as in the ordinary course of affairs. Mrs. John
had a great many sacrifices to make, of which her
daughter was quite unconscious. And to-night the
poor lady felt it, as with her mind so full she sat
down at her little solitary table, which she had made
pretty for Hester. There was nothing on it more
luxurious than cold meat and salad, but the crisp
greenness of the leaves, the little round loaf, the pat
of butter in a small silver dish which was one of her
relics, the creaming glass of milk, all set out upon a
white cloth and lighted up by the two candles, would,
she had flattered herself, call out an admiring
exclamation when the girl came in out of the dark,
a little dazzled for the first moment by the light.
After she had said "Oh, yes, with pleasure," Mrs.
John came in and sat down and cried. Such a pretty
table laid out, and oh, for once, so much to say! her
mind so overflowing, her news so all important!
There could not be anything so exciting to talk
about, that was certain, on the other side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
partition, and this provoked and tantalised sense of
having herself far better entertainment for Hester
than she could be having, gave an insufferableness
to the position. At one moment Mrs. John thought
she must send for the girl, that she could not put up
with the disappointment, but she was much more
used to putting up with things, than to asserting
herself. She sat down very cheerlessly and ate a
mouthful of bread and salad. To eat alone is always
miserable. Hester was making the table, where the
old Morgans sat, very lively and cheerful, talking as
she never talked with her mother. They sat and
talked quite late into the night. What with the
captain's stories, and Mrs. Morgan's elucidations
and Hester's questionings, the evening was full of
interest. It flew away so quickly that when the clock
struck eleven the girl sprang up with a great sense
of guilt. "Eleven o'clock! what will mother say?
I have never been so late before," she cried. They
were all half proud of it, of having been so mutually
entertaining. "The poor little mother must have
felt lonely," Mrs. Morgan said, with a passing
compunction when Hester flew round the corner,
watched from the door to see that all was safe by
the maid; but the captain took no notice. "It is
delightful to see how that child enjoys herself,"
he said, flattered in spite of himself, "though it's
no very intoxicating amusement we furnish her."
Captain Morgan was very soft-hearted, and understood
by his affections as well as with his understanding,
but in this case something beguiled him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
perhaps a little complacency, perhaps want of
thought.</p>

<p>When Hester ran in, in the dark, locking the
door of the verandah behind her, Mrs. John had
gone up stairs and was going to bed. She was
chilly and "cross" her daughter thought, who ran
quickly up to her full of apologies. "We got
talking," she said; "you must forgive me, mother.
The captain's stories run on so, one into another&mdash;one
forgets how the time runs on too."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Mrs. John, with the tears very
near the surface, "that your mother was sometimes
as amusing as the captain." It was the greatest reproach
she had addressed to her daughter for years.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! If I had thought you minded,"
cried Hester, with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. John was penitent at once, and did her best
to make things up. "I ought not to speak," she
said, "after all&mdash;for I was not so very lonely. Harry
stayed a long time and kept me company. It is
only when you have him to yourself that you see
how nice he is."</p>

<p>"Is he so nice?" said Hester, indifferently.
"How lucky for him to find you alone," she added,
with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hester, how can you say so. As if it was
me he came for! Whatever you may try to make
yourself believe you can't think that."</p>

<p>Hester made no reply. She slept in a small room
within her mother's, the door of which always stood
open. She had taken off her out-door things and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
let down her hair to brush it. It hung about her in
a cloud, running up into curls as soon as she let it
free. Mrs. John, seated in the easiest chair, sat
contemplating this operation with a mixture of
pleasure and pain. The mass of curls was pretty,
but it was not the fashion. It was quite unlike the
smooth brown glossy locks that had adorned her own
head when she was young. But she said to herself
that it suited Hester, and gazed at her child
admiringly, yet anxiously, conscious of many things
in which she might be improved: her hair for one
thing: and her waist, which was not so small as
Mrs. John's had been in her youth: and her nose,
which was a little too short. And yet with all these
defects she was pretty. When she was Harry's wife
everybody would admire her. Perhaps it was only
because she was not sufficiently seen that she had no
more admirers now.</p>

<p>"I had a great deal to say to you, dear," she said.
"I don't grudge you being away when you are
enjoying yourself, but I had many things to say.
It is not likely that Harry Vernon would sit with
me for hours for nothing."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Hester, from the midst of her
curls, "that he finds it dull now without Ellen at
the White House?"</p>

<p>"I could tell you a great deal about that," said
her mother quickly, eager to seize an opening. But
Hester yawned with discouraging demonstrations of
fatigue.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it will keep till to-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
mother? We had a long walk, and I am sleepy.
I think Harry can't be very urgent. To-morrow
will be time enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hester, how strange you are," cried Mrs.
John, "so pleased with those old people, ready to
listen to all their old stories; but when I begin to
talk to you of a thing that is of the greatest
importance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing concerning Harry Vernon can be of
great importance to me," cried the perverse girl;
and then she tried to turn off her wilfulness with a
laugh. "The beauty of the captain's stories is that
they are of no importance, mother. You can have
them when you please. It is like going to a theatre,
or reading a book."</p>

<p>"I am not so clever as the captain to interest
you," Mrs. John said.</p>

<p>There was a plaintive tone in her voice with which
Hester was very well acquainted, and which betokened
an inclination to tears. She came and
kissed her mother, and gave her a few of those
half-impatient caresses which generally soothed the
poor lady. The girl did not in the least know that
any consciousness was in Mrs. John's mind of the
superficial character of those kindnesses. She was
not without love for the tender domestic creature
who had been hers to use at her pleasure since ever
she could recollect, but she bestowed these kisses
upon her, as she would have given sweetmeats to
a child.</p>

<p>"Go to bed, mother. Don't mind me. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
shut the door; you shall not have the light in
your eyes to keep you from sleeping. Go to bed,
mammy darling."</p>

<p>Mrs. John had liked this caressing talk when
Hester was a child. She was soothed by it still,
though a faint sense that there was something like
contempt in it had got into her mind: and she could
not struggle against a will which was so much
stronger than her own. But she could not sleep,
though she allowed herself to be put to bed. She
could not help crying in the night, and wondering
what she could do to be more respected, to be more
important to her child; and then she prayed that
she might be able to put Harry before her in the
best light, and stopped and wondered whether it were
right to pray about a young man. Altogether Mrs.
John had not a tranquil night.</p>

<p>But next morning she made a great effort to dismiss
her anxiety, to present herself at breakfast with
a cheerful aspect, and to get rid of that plaintive
tone which she was herself aware of, which she had
so often tried to remedy. Instead of it she tried a
little jauntiness and gaiety, for extremes are always
easy. It is the <i>juste-milieu</i> which it is so difficult to
attain.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I scolded you last night, Hester. I
was cross when you came back. One can't help
being cross when one has a great many things to say
and no audience," she said with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, mamma. I did not mean to
stay so late."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it was nothing, my dear. I had Harry. He
sat with me a long time. He is&mdash;really&mdash;very&mdash;entertaining
when you have him to yourself."</p>

<p>"Is he?" said Hester demurely. "I should not
have expected that: but I am very glad, mother,
for your sake."</p>

<p>"Because I am likely to see a great deal of him
in the future? Oh yes, my dear. I hope so, at
least. He is very kind to me. Nobody has spoken
so nicely of me for many a year."</p>

<p>"I like him for that," said Hester honestly, yet
with a blush of self-consciousness; for perhaps
though she liked him for it, it did not improve
her opinion of Harry's intellect, that he should
find her mother's company so congenial.</p>

<p>"Oh, you would if you knew him better, Hester.
He feels for me in my changed circumstances. You
don't know how different things used to be, what a
great deal people used to think of me when I was
young. I don't complain, for perhaps it was silly of
them; but it is a great change. But living where
he does in my house, you know, Harry feels that: he
says it is there I ought to be&mdash;in the White House.
Even though nothing should ever come of it, it is
nice that somebody should think so."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately nothing can ever come of it," said
Hester. "However nice people may be they do not
give up their house to you, or their living; for you
would need his money as well, to be able to live in
the White House."</p>

<p>"You say unfortunately, dear," said her mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
with eagerness. Mrs. John blushed like a girl as
she began her attempt to hint out Harry's love-tale
to her daughter. She was innocent and modest,
though she was silly. No talk about lovers, no "petty
maxims" about marriage, had ever offended Hester's
ears. Her mother blushed and trembled when
she felt herself broaching the subject to her child.
"Oh, Hester, it would be easy, very easy, to cease to
be unfortunate&mdash;if you choose, dear. All that part
of our life might fly away like a cloud&mdash;if you
choose. We might be done with poverty and dependence
and thinking of what Catherine will say
and what people will think. The White House&mdash;might
be yours if you liked, everything might be
yours. You would only have to say the word."</p>

<p>Mrs. John's eyes filled with tears. She could not
get to the end of a long speech like this without
crying; and she was so anxious, that they found
their way also into her voice.</p>

<p>"Mother!" cried Hester, opening wide her eyes.
They were very bright and clear, and when they
opened widely looked almost unnatural in their size.
She was all the more startled that she had never
been subject to any such representation before. "I
don't know what you mean," she said. "What
should we do with the White House? I think it is
a vulgar, staring place, and far too big."</p>

<p>"Don't speak so, Hester. I can't bear it. My own
married home that your poor papa took me to!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, mother. I had forgotten that.
Of course taste was different in those days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, taste! Your poor papa had beautiful taste.
There are some things there that just break my
heart&mdash;the ormolu set that everybody admired so,
and the picture of me over the mantel-piece in the
little parlour. It used to be in the drawing-room,
but you can't wonder at them changing it. The hair
was worn high then, on the top of your head, and
short sleeves. It was very becoming to me. And to
hear you call it vulgar and staring&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was a mistake, mamma. I did not think
what I was saying. Forgive me, mother dear!"</p>

<p>"You know I would forgive you anything," cried
Mrs. John, now fairly launched, and forgetting all
prudential restraints. "But oh, Hester, my darling,
when he speaks to you don't be hasty; think of all
that is involved. I am not going to tell you what
he wants to say&mdash;oh no, he would never forgive me.
It is he himself that must tell you that. But Hester,
oh, don't speak hastily; don't answer all in a
moment, without thinking. Often, often a girl says
what she is sorry for, not being prepared. Think,
my darling, what it would be&mdash;not only to be rich,
but to be independent&mdash;to have your own house, all
your own, and no charity&mdash;to have as much money
as you want, to be able to help the poor, and do
everything you wish, and to make me happy, so
happy, to the end of my days!"</p>

<p>It was thus that Mrs. John treated Harry's secret.
She forgot all her precautions and her conviction
that from himself only the proposal ought to come.
The dialogues she had invented, the long conversations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
with Hester which she had held in imagination,
delicately, diplomatically leading up to the main possibility,
had all disappeared when the moment came.
When she began to speak she had forgotten them
altogether, and gone off impromptu without recollecting
a syllable of all that had been so painfully prepared:
and her own eloquence, if it did not affect
her daughter, affected herself beyond description: her
mouth quivered, the tears flowed out of her eyes.
Hester, who could no more bear to see her mother
cry (though she had seen that sight often enough)
than to see the tears of a child, rose from her seat,
and coming round hurriedly behind Mrs. John's
chair put her arms caressingly round her, and laid
her cheek to that wet one. She was not so entirely
unprepared but that she understood well enough
what this emotion meant, but she tried to look
as if it had a different meaning altogether. She
drew her mother's head to her breast and kissed
her.</p>

<p>"Dear mother! Is it really so bitter to you to
be dependent? and you never let me know that
you felt it."</p>

<p>"What would have been the good," said the poor
lady, "when we could do nothing? The thing was
to put the best face upon it. But now when it is
all in your power&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was always in my power," said Hester, with a
mixture of real earnestness and a desire to persuade
her mother that she put a different meaning
upon all that had been said; "if you had not stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
me, mother; but I have not lost my accent, and if
you will only give your consent now&mdash;I am older,
and people will trust me with their children."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hester, do not vex me so," cried Mrs. John.
"Do you think that is what I mean? And besides,
if I were to give you leave to-morrow, Catherine, you
know, would never consent."</p>

<p>"If you will trust to me," said Hester, colouring
high, "what Catherine pleases shall not be the last
word."</p>

<p>Mrs. John wrung her hands, drawing herself out
of Hester's arms, to gaze into her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, why will you make such a mistake? It is
not <i>that</i>. I am not strong to stand out against you,
Hester, but for your own sake. And Catherine would
never let you do it. Oh, this is quite a different
thing, my dear love! Not to work like any poor
girl, but to be far above that, to have everything
that heart could desire. And all so right and so
nice, and so suitable, Hester. If your dear papa had
lived and all had gone well I could not have wished
for a better match."</p>

<p>"Match!" said the girl, colouring violently.</p>

<p>She had indeed understood well enough that
Harry was behind all her mother's anxious insinuations,
her promises and entreaties, but she had been
confident in her power to defeat Mrs. John by aid
of her own confused statements always capable of
bearing two meanings. This word "match," however,
was one upon which there could be no confusion,
and she was immediately driven to bay. She drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
herself away from the tender attitude in which she
had been standing.</p>

<p>"I never thought," she said, "that this was a thing
that could be discussed between us," with all the
unreasonable indignation of a high-handed girl, determined
to crush all attempts to influence her on
the spot.</p>

<p>But Mrs. John, though she was conscious she
could not stand against Hester, was too sure that she
was right, and too deeply convinced of the importance
of this great question to give in, as she usually
did.</p>

<p>"Oh why should it not be discussed between us?"
she said. "Is there any one so much interested as
I am? I have heard people say it was a mother's
duty. And Hester, abroad where we used to live, I
should have settled it altogether&mdash;you would never
have been consulted. I am sure I don't know that
it is not the best way."</p>

<p>"It is a way&mdash;that could never have been taken
with me," Hester said. She walked round to her
own side of the table with a very stately aspect and
sat down, and made a pretence of resuming her
breakfast, but her hand trembled with excitement
as she took up her cup. "It may be quite true what
you say, that you are interested, mother. I suppose
so. People consider a girl a piece of goods to be sold
and disposed of."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hester, have I ever thought so? I have
been wanting in my duty," cried Mrs. John. "I
have never tried to put you forward, to get you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
invitations, to have you seen and admired as other
people do. You are so proud and so fanciful that I
have never dared to do it. And when there comes
one, without ever being invited, or thought of, or
supposed possible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It seemed to Hester that the burning blush which
she felt go all over her was capable of bursting into
flame. It was not the shy shamefacedness with
which every girl contemplates this subject on its first
introduction, but bitter and scorching shame.</p>

<p>"Invited&mdash;thought of; mother!" she cried in a
voice of girlish thunder; "is it possible that you
could ever think of scheming&mdash;match-making&mdash;for
<span class="smcap">me</span>?"</p>

<p>No capitals could represent the fervour of her
indignation. She was entirely unconscious of the
arrogance of self-opinion that was in all she said.
For <span class="smcap">me</span>. That a man should be invited into her presence
with that thought, that she should be put
forward, taken into society in order to be seen with
that view. Heaven and Earth! was it possible that
a woman should avow such possibilities and yet live?</p>

<p>"When I tell you that I never did it, Hester!
though I know it was my duty," Mrs. John cried
with tears. Never was woman punished more
unjustly. She turned like the proverbial worm at
the supreme inappropriateness of this judgment
against her, and a sudden impulse of anger sustained
the gentle little woman. "I know it was my duty,"
she cried; "for who is to care for you, to see that
you are settled in life, but me? But I was afraid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
do it. I was obliged to leave it&mdash;to Providence. I
just said to myself, it is no use. Hester would never
be guided by me. I must leave it&mdash;to Providence."</p>

<p>It did not appear that Mrs. John had much opinion
of Providence in such matters, for she announced this
with a voice of despair. Then taking courage a little,
she said with insinuating gentleness&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was just the same when I was a girl. I could
not endure to hear about settlements and things. It
was all love I thought of&mdash;my darling. I was like
you&mdash;all love."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!" cried Hester, jumping to her feet.
This was more intolerable than the other. Her face
flamed anew with the suggestion that it was "all
love." "For Heaven's sake don't say any more about
it, unless you want to drive me out of my senses,"
she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. John stopped crying, she was so astonished,
and gazed with open mouth and eyes. She had
thought this last tender touch would be irresistible,
that the child would fall into her arms, and perhaps
breathe forth the sweetest secret aspiration of her
heart&mdash;perhaps own to her that dark eyes and a
moustache had been her dream instead of Harry's
fairness; or that a melting voice or a genius for
poetry were absolute requirements of her hero. With
all these fancies she would have so tenderly sympathised.
She would have liked to discuss everything,
to point out that after all a fair complexion was very
nice, and a genius for poetry not profitable. She
remembered what occupation and delight these same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
subjects had afforded herself in the interval before
John Vernon had proposed to her. She herself had
dreamed of a troubadour, a lonely being with a
guitar, with long hair and misfortunes; and John
Vernon had none of these attractions. She was
talked over by her mother and sister and made to
see that the Bank and the White House were far
better. Hester, perhaps, would have been more
difficult, but yet she had felt that, confidence once
established, the sweetness of these discussions would
have been unspeakable. When she had got over
her astonishment, she sank back in a despair which
was not unmingled with resentment. Had it come to
that, that nothing a mother could say would please a
child nowadays&mdash;neither the attraction of a great
match nor the tenderness of love?</p>

<p>This was how the great question of a young woman's
life was first revealed to Hester. It was not, to be
sure, the last word. That would come when she was
placed face to face with the aspirant for her favour
and have to decide, so to speak, upon the future of
two lives. But to say "no" to Harry would not have
excited and confused her being, like this previous
encounter with all the other powers and influences
which were concerned&mdash;or which were considered to
be concerned, in her fate.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>AN INDIGNANT SPECTATOR.</h3>


<p>Hester Vernon had been, during the most important
years of her existence, a sort of outlaw from
life. She had been unacquainted altogether with
its course and natural order, out of all its usual
habits, separated from every social way of thinking
or discipline of mind. She belonged to a little
community which thought a great deal of itself,
yet had no foundation for so doing; but, strangely
enough, though she saw through the fallacy of its
general pretensions, she yet kept its tradition in
her own person and held her head above the ordinary
world in unconscious imitation of the neighbours
whom she knew to have no right to do so. She
kept the spirit of the Vernons, though she scorned
them, and thought them a miserable collection
of ungrateful dependents and genteel beggars, less
honourable than the real beggars, who said "thank
you" at least. And she had no way of correcting
the unfortunate estimate of the world she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
formed from this group, except through the means
of Catherine Vernon, and the society in her house,
of which, at long intervals, and on a doubtful footing
which set all her pride in arms and brought out every
resentful faculty, she and her mother formed a part.
If the Vernon-Ridgways and Mr. Mildmay Vernon
were bitterly critical of Catherine, missing no opportunity
to snarl at the hand that fed them, Catherine,
on her part, was so entirely undeceived in respect
to them, and treated them with such a cynical
indulgence and smiling contempt, as if nothing save
ingratitude and malice were to be expected from
humanity, that Hester had found no relief on that
side from her painful thoughts. She was so conscious
in her own person of meanings more high,
and impulses more noble, that the scorn with which
she contemplated the people about her was almost
inevitable. And when, deeply against her will, and
always with an uneasy consciousness that her mother's
pleasure in the invitations, and excitement about
going, was childish and undignified, Hester found
herself in a corner of the Grange drawing-room, her
pride, her scornful indignation and high contempt of
society, grew and increased. Her poor little mother
standing patiently smiling at all who would smile at
her, pleased with the little recognition given her as
"one of the poor ladies at the Vernonry," and quite
content to remain there for hours for the sake of two
minutes' <i>banal</i> conversation now and then, to be
overlooked at supper, and taken compassion upon by
a disengaged curate, or picked up by some man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
had already brought back a more important guest,
made Hester furious and miserable by her complacency.
Hester herself was one of some half
dozen girls in white muslin, who kept a wistful eye
upon the curate in the hope of being taken away to
the supper-room down stairs, from which such a
sound of talk and laughter came up to the forlorn
ones left above. But no curate, however urgent, ever
persuaded Hester to go down, to stand at the tail of
the company and consume the good things on
Catherine's table. She saw it all from that point of
view which takes the glitter off the brightest surface.
Why did those poor girls in white muslin, not being
compelled, like Hester, continue to go? There were
two sisters, who would chatter together, pretending
to be very merry, and point out to each other the
pictures, or some new piece of furniture, and say that
Miss Vernon had such taste. They were always of
the number of those who were forgotten at supper,
who were sent down after the others came up stairs
with careless little apologies. Why did they come?
But Hester was not of a temper to chatter or to look
at the pictures, or to make the best of the occasion.
She stood in the corner behind her mother, and made
it quite clear that she was not "enjoying herself."
She took no interest in the pieces that were performed
on the piano, or the songs that were sung,
and even rejected the overtures of her companions in
misfortune to point out to her the "very interesting
photographs" which covered one table. Some of
the elder ladies who talked to her mother made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
matters worse by compassionately remarking that
"the poor girl" was evidently "terribly shy." But,
otherwise, nobody took any notice of Hester; the
other people met each other at other houses, had
some part in the other amusements which were going
on, and knew what to say to each other. But Hester
did not know what to say. Edward Vernon, her
early acquaintance, whom she would still often meet
in the morning, and between whom and Hester
there existed a sort of half-and-half alliance unlike
her relations with any one else, took no open notice
of her; but would sometimes cast a glance at her as
he passed, confidential and secret. "How are you
getting on?" he would say; and when Hester
answered "Not at all," would shrug his shoulders
and elevate his eyebrows and say "Nor I" under
his breath. But if he did not "get on," his manner
of non-enjoyment was, at least, very different from
Hester's. He was, as it were, Catherine Vernon's
son and representative. He was the temporary
master of the house. Everybody smiled upon him,
deferred to him, consulted his wishes. Thus, even
Edward, though she regarded him with different
eyes from the others, helped to give a greater
certainty to Hester's opinion on the subject of
Society. Even he was false here&mdash;pretending to
dislike what he had no reason to dislike, and, what
was perhaps worse, leaving her to stand there neglected,
whom he was willing enough to talk with
when he found her alone.</p>

<p>Hester felt&mdash;with her head raised, her nostrils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
expanded, a quiver of high indignation in her lip&mdash;that
she herself would never suffer any one to stand
thus neglected in any room of hers. Those women
in their diamonds, who swept down stairs while her
mother stood and looked on wistfully, should not be
the first in her house. She would not laugh and say
"One of the Vernonry," as Catherine permitted
herself to do. It seemed to Hester that the poor
and the small would be the first whom she would
think of, and amuse and make happy. They should
have the best of everything, they who had not the
best of anything in life. Society (she thought, always
in that corner, where there was full time to make
theories, and the keen prick of present humiliation
to give animation to them) should be a fine compensation
to those who were not so happy as the
others. A true hostess should lay herself out to
make up to them, for that one genial moment, for
the absence of beauty and brightness in their lives.
It should be all for them&mdash;the music, and the wit,
and the happy discourse. Those who lived in fine
houses, who had everything that wealth could give,
should stand aside and give place to the less happy.
There should be no one neglected. The girl whom
no one noticed stood apart and invented her high
magnanimous court, where there should be no respect
of persons. But it was not wonderful if in this real
one she felt herself standing upon a pedestal, and
looked out with scorn upon the people who were
"enjoying themselves," and with a sense of bitter mortification
watched her poor little mother curtseying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
and smiling, pleased to go down to supper after the
fine people were satisfied, on somebody's benevolent
arm who was doing duty for the second time.
"No, I thank you," Hester said to the curate, who
stood offering his arm, tossing her head like a young
princess. "I never go to supper." She was not
without a consciousness either, that Catherine, hearing
this, had been mightily amused by her airs and
her indignation, and next time looked out for them
as one of the humours of the night.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that all Hester's small experience
of society taught her to despise it. She was
outside of the life of families, and knew little or
nothing of the ordinary relations of parents and
children, and of that self-sustaining life where there
are no painful bonds of obligation, no dependence,
no forced submission of one set of people to another.
She thought the mass was all the same, with such
exceptions as old Captain Morgan and his wife
rarely appearing, and here and there a visionary,
indignant soul such as herself, free as yet from all
bonds, looking on with proud consciousness that were
power in her hands it should not be so. The great
question of love had scarcely flitted at all across her
firmament. She had indeed a trembling sense of
possibility such as youth itself could not be youth if
destitute of, a feeling that some time suddenly there
might come down upon her path out of the skies, or
appear out of the distance, some one&mdash;in whom all
the excellences of earth should be realised; but this,
it need not be said, was as entirely unlike an ideal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
preference for dark eyes and moustaches, as it was
unlike the orthodox satisfaction in a good match
which her mother had so abruptly revealed. It was
like the dawn upon the horizon where as yet there is
no sun and no colour, a visionary, tremulous premonition
of the possible day. A girl who has this
feeling in her heart is not only horrified but angry,
when the fact comes down upon her in the shape of
a dull man's proposal or a parent's recommendation.
It is a wrong to herself and to him, and to the new
earth and the new heaven which might be coming.
Hester left her mother on that memorable morning
with the glow of a fiery resentment in her heart.
Everything seemed to grow vulgar under that touch,
even things which were heavenly. Not a magnanimous
hero, but Harry&mdash;not a revelation out of
heaven, out of the unknown, but a calculation of
his good qualities and the comforts he could bestow.
All this no doubt was very highflown and absurd,
but the girl knew no better. She felt it an insult to
her, that her mother should have set such a bargain
before her&mdash;and oh, worse than an insult, intolerable!
when poor Mrs. John, in her ignorance, invited the
confidence of this high visionary maiden on the
subject of love. This drove the girl away, incapable
of supporting such profanation and blasphemy. She
went out upon the Common, where she could be
quite alone, and spent an hour or two by herself
beyond reach of anybody, trying to shake off the
impression. She had nothing to do to occupy her
mind, to force out of it an unpleasant subject. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
could only rush out and secure for herself solitude at
least, that she might master it and get it under
her feet.</p>

<p>But sometimes to appoint a meeting with yourself
to discuss such a question, ends in another way from
that which has been foreseen. Sitting alone under a
bush of whins, some chance touch of fancy made
Hester think of her mother's aspirations towards the
White House, the ormolu set, and the portrait in
short sleeves. Thoughts arise sometimes in a curious
dramatic order, to all appearance independent of the
mind of the thinker, as if certain pictures were
presented to it by some independent agency outside.
In this way there gleamed across the mind of Hester
a sudden presentation of her mother in those same
short sleeves, her pretty dark hair in two large bows
on the top of her head, her feet in white satin shoes
with sandals, like an artless beauty out of the
<i>Keepsake</i> or the <i>Forget-me-not</i>. The imagination was
so sudden that in the midst of thoughts so different
it tempted the girl to a smile. Poor mother, so young
and pretty&mdash;and silly, perhaps! And then Hester
recollected old Mr. Rule's story, how she had rushed
to her desk and produced twenty pounds to save the
bank from bankruptcy. The girl recollected, with an
indignant pang of compassion, that Catherine had
produced thousands of pounds, and <i>had</i> saved the
bank. What virtue was that in her? She had the
money whilst the other had not, and Mrs. John's
helpless generosity was just as great. Poor little
mother! and the house she was so proud of, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
"married home," her ideal of everything that was fine
and handsome. Hester's imagination after this made
a jump, and beheld her mother in the widow's dress
of black which she never left off, standing, glad of
any crumbs of notice which might fall to her in the
corner of the drawing-room where Catherine the
successful reigned supreme. It angered the girl that
her mother should be so humble-minded&mdash;but yet it
was quite characteristic of her. And what a contrast
was in those two scenes! Who made her think of
this at the very moment when, rushing out to escape
from her mother, she had felt the gulf of incomprehension
between them more bitterly than ever before?
It could not be anything but a kind influence that
did it, a good fairy, or even perhaps a friendly angel,
grieved at the emancipation of this child from the
tenderest bonds of nature. Anyhow Hester thought,
with a sudden moistening of her eyelids, of the
pretty creature in the picture and the widow in the
black gown at the same moment. From white satin
to crape, from twenty to fifty&mdash;ah, and more than
these, from the thoughtless prosperity of a creature
who had never known anything different, to the
humiliation borne so sweetly of the too-submissive
artless soul. Her eyelids moistened, and the sun
caught them, and amused himself making tiny
rainbows in the long lashes. Hester's heart too was
caught and touched. Poor <i>petite m&egrave;re</i>! how much, as
she would have said herself, she had "gone through!"</p>

<p>And then something occurred to Hester which
made her set her white teeth and clench her hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
If she pleased she could set that right again which
was so wrong. She could put back her mother in
the White House she loved, take down the innocent
portrait in white satin, and hang it in the place of
honour once more; throw open finer rooms than
Catherine's for the reception of, oh! so different a
company&mdash;society in which no one should be overlooked,
and in which Catherine's gentle rival should
be supreme. She could do all this if she chose. The
thought suddenly bursting upon her made her head
go round. She could put her mother in the place
from which it seemed (wrongly, but yet that was so
natural an impression) Catherine had driven her,
turn the tables altogether upon Catherine, and make
a new centre, a new head, everything new. The girl
raised her head with a little shake and toss like a
high-bred horse, as this strange and sudden suggestion
came into her mind like an arrow. She could do it
all. The suggestion that she could do it when it
came from her mother had been an insult and
wrong; but when it came as it did now, though
there was horror in it, there was also temptation, the
sharp sting of an impulse. What was the dreadful
drawback? Nothing but Harry: no monster, nothing
terrible, a good fellow, a docile mind&mdash;one who had
never been unkind. Hester had judged him with
his sister for a long time, but of late days she had
learned to separate Harry from Ellen. He had always
been <i>nice</i>, as Mrs. John said&mdash;not great indeed or
noble, but honest and kind in his simple way. Once
at least (Hester remembered) he had&mdash;what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
nothing less than heroic in the circumstances&mdash;stepped
forward, broken all the Redborough laws of
precedence, and "taken down" her mother at one of
the Grange parties, in entire indifference to the fact
that ladies more great were waiting for his arm.
This recollection jumped suddenly into her mind as
she sat in the solitude thinking it all over. He had
always done his best, coming to her, standing by her
side, with not much to say indeed, but with a sort of
silent championship which Hester had laughed at,
but which she remembered now. He was not very
often present at the Grange parties; but when he
was there, this was what he had done. It was no
great matter, but in the excited state of her mind it
told upon her. Edward came only by moments when
the company was otherwise engaged, and then spoke
to her rather by signs, by that shrug of the shoulders
and elevation of the eyebrows, than in words. But
Harry had penetrated to her corner and stood by her,
making himself rather larger than usual that everybody
might see him. The ungrateful girl had laughed,
and had not been proud of her large-limbed champion;
but when she thought of it now her heart melted to
him. <i>He</i> had not been afraid of what people would
say. And after all, to be able to set everything
right, to restore her mother's comfort and exaltation,
to be free and rich, with no greater drawback than
Harry, would that be so difficult to bear? She
shivered at the thought; but yet, that she did so
much as ask herself this question showed how far
already her thoughts had gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>After the untoward conversation of this morning,
Mrs. John took great pains to keep Harry back. She
ventured even to write a note to him, composed in
great anxiety, very much underlined and emphatic.
"I have sounded her, and find her mind <i>a complete
blank</i> on that subject. She has never thought about
it, and <i>she has seen no one</i>, as you remarked. If you
will but put off a little, I feel sure it will be followed
by <span class="smcap">the happiest results</span>." Circumstances, as it
happened, served Mrs. John's purpose, and made it
indispensable to put off a little any formal advances.
For Harry had to leave Redborough on business for
a week or two. His consequent absence from the
Vernonry was seen with great satisfaction by the
neighbours, who knew no reason for that absence.</p>

<p>"He has seen his mistake in time," the Miss
Vernon-Ridgways said, congratulating each other,
as if the destruction of poor Hester's supposed hopes
and projects was some gain to them; and Mr. Mildmay
Vernon nodded his head over his newspaper,
and chuckled and announced that Harry was no fool.
They all remarked with much particularity to Mrs. John
that her visitor had not long continued his assiduities.</p>

<p>"But we can't expect, you know, that a young
man should always be coming out here," said Miss
Matilda. "What was there to gain by it? and that
is the rule nowadays. Besides, dear Catherine
does not like these nephews of hers, as she calls
them&mdash;no more nephews than I am!&mdash;to see too
much of <i>us</i>. They might hear things which she
wouldn't wish them to hear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Mildmay's remark was jaunty like himself.
"So Harry has given you up! Young dog, it's
what they all do, you know. He loves and he rides
away. I was no better myself, I suppose."</p>

<p>Mrs. John could have cried with humiliation and
pain. She explained that Mr. Harry was absent;
that he had told her he was going away; but these
kind people laughed in her face. Perhaps this too
had a certain effect upon Hester's mind. She heard
the laugh, though her mother did all she could to
keep her from hearing; and an impulse to show
them her power&mdash;to prove once for all that she could
have everything they prized, the money, and the
finery, and the "position," which they all envied and
sneered at, when she pleased&mdash;an impulse less noble,
but also keener than the previous one, came suddenly
into her mind. When Harry came back, however,
Hester quailed at the thought of the possibility
which she had not rejected. She saw him coming,
and stole out the other way, round the pond and
under the pine-trees, so as to be able to reach the
house of the Morgans without being seen. And
when Harry appeared he had to run the gauntlet
of the three bitter spectators, the chorus of the little
drama, without seeing its heroine.</p>

<p>"Dear Harry, back again!" the Miss Vernon-Ridgways
cried; "how nice of you to come again.
We made up our minds you had given us up. It
was so natural that you should tire of us, a set of
shabby people. And dear Catherine is so fond of
you; she likes to keep you to herself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know that she's so fond of me. I've
been in town on business," Harry said, eager to
escape from them.</p>

<p>Mr. Mildmay patted him on the shoulder with his
newspaper. "Keep your free will, my boy," he said;
"don't give in to habits. Come when you please,
and go when you please&mdash;that's a man's rule."</p>

<p>Harry looked at this feeble Mephistopheles as if
he would have liked to kick him, but of course he
did not; because he was feeble and old, and "a cad,"
as the young man said in his heart; and so went in
by the verandah door to see Hester, and found her
not, which was hard, after what he had gone through.
Mrs. John pinned him down for a talk, which she
was nervously anxious for, and which he, after the
first moment, liked well enough too; and perhaps it
was as well, he consented to think, that he should
see how the land lay.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hester very cautiously had crept into
the house of the old people next door. The two
houses were divided only by a partition, yet how
different the atmosphere was! The keen inquisitions
of the Vernonry, its hungry impatience to
know and see everything, its satirical comments, its
inventions of evil motives, were all unknown here.
And even her mother's anxieties for her own advancement
put a weary element into life, which in
the peaceful parlour of the old captain and his wife
existed no more than any other agitation. The old
lady seated in the window, putting down her book well
pleased when the visitor came in, was an embodiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of tranquillity. She had lived no easy life; she
had known many troubles and sorrows, laboured
hard and suffered much; but all that was over.
Her busy hands were still, her heart at rest. Hester
did not know sometimes what this great tranquillity
meant, whether it was the mere quiet of age, almost
mechanical, a blank of feeling, or if it was the calm
after great storms, the power of religious consolation
and faith. It filled her sometimes with a little awe&mdash;sometimes
with a sort of horror. To think that
she, with all the blood dancing in her veins, should
ever come to be like that! And yet even in her
small round she had seen enough to be sure that
these old people had a kind of happiness in their
quiet which few knew. Mrs. Morgan took off her
spectacles, and closed them within the book she had
been reading, well pleased when Hester appeared.
The captain had gone out; she was alone; and
perhaps she did not care very much for her book.
At all events, Hester was her favourite, and the
sight of the girl's bright looks and her youth,
her big eyes always full of wonder, her hair
that would scarcely keep straight, the "something
springy in her gait," pleased the old lady and did
her good.</p>

<p>"May I stay and talk to you?" Hester said.</p>

<p>"You shall stay, dear, certainly, if you think it
right; but I see everything from my window, and
Harry Vernon has just gone in to see your mother.
Do you know?"</p>

<p>"I saw him coming," Hester said, with a cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
upon her face, which looked like displeasure, but was
indeed the trouble of her self-discussion and doubt as
to what she should do.</p>

<p>"Something is wrong," said the old lady, "and you
have come to tell me. Are you going to marry Harry
Vernon, Hester?"</p>

<p>"Would that be something wrong?" cried the
girl, looking up quickly, with a certain irritation.
She did not mean to have so important a question
fore-judged in this easy way.</p>

<p>"That is according as you feel, my dear; but I
fear he is not good enough for you. Catherine
says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now the Morgans were altogether of Catherine's
faction, being her relations, and not&mdash;as the other
members of the community remembered with much
resentment&mdash;Vernons at all. It was a sinful use of
the family property as concentrated in Catherine's
hand, to support these old people who had no right
to it. More or less this was the sentiment of the
community generally, even, it is to be feared, of Mrs.
John herself; and consequently, as an almost
infallible result, they were on Catherine's side, and
took her opinions. Hester stopped the mouth of the
old lady, so to speak, hastily holding up her hand.</p>

<p>"That is a mistake," she cried; "Catherine is
quite wrong! She does not like him; but he is
honest as the skies&mdash;he is good. You must not
think badly of him because Catherine has a
prejudice against him."</p>

<p>"That is a rash thing for you to say. Catherine is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
a great deal older, and a great deal wiser than
you."</p>

<p>"She may be older, and she may be wiser; but
she does not know everything," said Hester. "There
is one prejudice of hers you don't share&mdash;she thinks
the same of me."</p>

<p>This staggered the old lady.</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;she does not understand you somehow;
things seem to go the wrong way between
times."</p>

<p>"Am I difficult to understand?" cried Hester. "I
am only nineteen, and Catherine is sixty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are not quite so easy as A B C," said Mrs.
Morgan, with a smile; "still I acknowledge that is
one thing against her judgment. But you do not
answer my question. Are you going to marry Harry
Vernon?"</p>

<p>Hester, seated in the shelter of the curtain, invisible
from outside, hardly visible within, looked out
across the Common to the place where she had sat
and pondered, and breathed a half-articulate "No."</p>

<p>"Then, Hester, you should tell him so," said the
old lady. "You should not keep him hanging on.
Show a little respect, my dear, to the man who has
shown so much respect to you."</p>

<p>"Do you call that respect?" said Hester, and then
she added, lowering her voice, "My mother wishes it.
She thinks it would make her quite happy. She says
that she would want nothing more."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the old lady, "that means&mdash;&mdash;" It
is to be feared that she was going to say something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
not very respectful to Hester's mother, about whom,
also, Catherine's prejudice told: but she checked
herself in time. "That gives it another aspect," she
said.</p>

<p>"Do you think it would be right to marry a man
only because your mother wished it?" asked Hester,
fixing her eyes on Mrs. Morgan's face.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said the old lady, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Sometimes! I thought you were like the
captain, and believed in love."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she said again. "It does not do in
every case: that is what I object to the captain and
you for. You are always so absolute. Love rejects
suitableness; and if Catherine is not quite wrong&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is quite wrong!" cried Hester again,
vehemently. "She does not know Harry any more
than she knows me. He is not clever, but he is
true."</p>

<p>"Then marry him, my dear."</p>

<p>"Why should I marry him?&mdash;one does not marry
every one whom Catherine misjudges&mdash;oh, there
would be too many!&mdash;nor even to please mother."</p>

<p>"I am perhaps as poor a judge as Catherine,
Hester."</p>

<p>"Now you are unjust&mdash;now you are unkind!"
cried the girl, with anger in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Come," said Mrs. Morgan, "you must not assault
me. You are so young and so fierce: and my old
man is not here to take my part."</p>

<p>"I cannot ask him, because he is a man," said
Hester; "but I know what he would say. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
not say 'Sometimes' like you; he would say
'Never!' And that is what I think too."</p>

<p>"Because you are so young, my dear; and my
old man, bless him, he is very young. But this
world is a very strange place. Right and wrong,
are like black and white; they are distinct and
easy. The things that baffle us are those that
perhaps are not quite right, but certainly are not
wrong."</p>

<p>"Do you call it not wrong&mdash;to do what your heart
revolts at to please your mother?"</p>

<p>"I call that right in one sense; but I would not
use such strong language, Hester," the old lady
said.</p>

<p>"This must be metaphysics," said the girl.
"Sophistry, isn't it? casuistry, I don't know what
to call it; but I see through you. It would be
right to do a great many things to please her, to
make my dress her way instead of mine, to stop
at home when she wanted me though I should like
to go out; but not&mdash;surely not, Mrs. Morgan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To marry the man of her choice, though he is
not your own?"</p>

<p>Hester nodded her head, her face glowing with the
sudden blush that went and came in a moment. She
was agitated though she did not wish to show it.
The impulse to do it became suffocating, the shiver
of repugnance stronger as she felt that the danger
was coming near.</p>

<p>"I am not so sure," said the old lady in her
passionless calm. "Sometimes such a venture turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
out very well; to please your mother is a very
good thing in itself, and if you are right about his
character, and care for no one else, and can do it&mdash;for
after all that is the great thing, my dear&mdash;<i>if
you can do it</i>&mdash;it might turn out very well, better
than if you took your own way."</p>

<p>"Is that all that is to be thought of, whether
it will turn out well?" cried Hester, indignantly.
"You mean if it is successful; but the best way is
not always successful."</p>

<p>"Success in marriage means almost everything,"
the old lady said.</p>

<p>Then there was a pause. Separated only by the
partition, Harry Vernon was discoursing with Mrs.
John on the same subject. He was telling her all
he would do for his wife when he got her. The
White House should be refurnished; but if she
pleased the best of the old things, "the ormolu and
all that rubbish," Harry said, which gave the poor
lady a wound in spite of her great and happy
emotion, should be put into the rooms which were
to be her rooms for life; but for Hester he would
have everything new. And he thought he saw his
way to a carriage: for the phaeton, though Ellen
was fond of it, was not quite the thing, he allowed,
for a lady. He had got just about that length, and
was going on, a little excited by his own anticipations,
and filling his future mother-in-law with
delight and happiness, when Hester, on the other
side of the wall, suddenly sprang up and cried,
throwing up her hands&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I cannot do it!" in tones so painful and so
clear that it was a wonder they did not penetrate
the wainscotting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan, who had been waiting for a reply,
folded her old fingers&mdash;worn with the hard usage
of life, but now so quiet&mdash;into each other, and
said, softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"That was what I thought."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3>CATHERINE'S OPINION.</h3>


<p>It is not to be supposed that Harry's visits, which
made so much commotion at the Vernonry, could
have entirely escaped the keen observation of the
Grange. Catherine Vernon shared, with most sovereigns
and the ruling class in general, the peculiarity,
not indeed a very unusual one, of liking to know
everything that went on within her sphere. It was
not as gossip, nor, she would have said with some
reason, from curiosity alone. She had for so long
been all-powerful, and sure that the means were in
her hand to help those that wanted help, and to
regulate affairs in general for the benefit of the
world, that it had become a necessity, almost a duty
on her part, to keep herself informed of everything
that went on. When an individual feels capable of
performing the part of a visible Providence, it
becomes incumbent upon that person, so far as
possible, to know everything, to shut his eyes to no
detail, to note every little incident, and to encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
not only the confidences of his possible clients and
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>, but the observations of all surrounding them,
and every hint as to their motives, their intentions
and purposes, that can be got at. The outside crowd,
knowing nothing of the meaning of these investigations,
is apt to mistake them altogether; but
Catherine did not care much about the outside world.
It was her wish that everything should be told her,
and she was perhaps too apt to think that those who
were not willing or able to open their hearts, were
people who had secrets in their life, and probably a
good deal that would not bear the light. She liked
her friends to bring her news, and never thought
anything too trivial to be added to the mass of
information which was in her hands. She knew the
habits of her neighbours, and the good and evil
fortune that befell them, better sometimes than they
did themselves. Parents, who were doubtful about
the proceedings of their sons, had they asked
Catherine, would have known all about them. So
the prince, in a little State, may often interest
himself graciously about the affairs of his subjects,
and monarchs are the best of genealogists, knowing
who married who all the world over, even outside of
the Almanach de Gotha. It is not a taste which can
be indulged without falling into an occasional appearance
of pettiness; but yet there is a great deal to be
said for this degree of interest in our fellow creatures,
and there is no way in which it can be kept up so
well as in a country town, where everybody knows
everybody else. This is perhaps rather an elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
preface to introduce the simple fact that Catherine
Vernon from the very beginning had known of
Harry's visit to the Vernonry. Her own woman,
Meredith by name, shared her mistress's task, without
Catherine's fine reason for it, and carried it deeper
than Catherine, not refusing any garbage of the lanes
to satisfy her appetite. And she was a woman who
saw everything and knew everybody. It was no
more than Harry's second or third visit when she
pointed him out to her mistress, walking past in his
summer morning suit, which the long evenings
permitted a young man to retain while daylight
lasted and he could be about. Harry was very
carefully got up; he wore light clothes, and ties
of the most interesting description. He had always
the stick which was in fashion, the hat of the
moment; and a very pleasant sight he was striding
along in the summer evening, going where love
carried him, with honest intentions and a simple
heart. He was not perhaps capable of a very refined
or poetical sentiment. He had at that time no doubt
whatever that Hester would accept him gratefully,
not so much for himself (in which point he had an
instinctive humility), but for the good things he
could give her. The glamour and the thousand little
enchantments of love were not in him, but he was
honest and true, as Hester had said. He meant this
poor girl, whom most people, in Catherine's drawing-room
and elsewhere, passed by without notice, though
some thought her pretty&mdash;he meant her as his wife
to be a happy and much-honoured woman. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
what was more, he meant to be good to his mother-in-law.
He might have been a romantic paladin, or
a man of genius, and not have been so excellent, so
worthy of all admiration as that. It never occurred
to Harry to go another way, to conceal what he was
about from prying eyes. He was not ashamed of
what he was about. All the world might watch his
steps so far as he cared, and it must have required a
distinct effort on the part of any honest heart not to
like the sight of him as he went a-wooing, and wish
him a happy ending. Perhaps it would be too much
to say that Catherine made that effort; but she was
not favourable to Harry as to his cousin who was
under her own roof.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible for any eyes but those of a
parent (and even the eyes of a parent are not always
impartial) to look upon two young candidates for
favour with exactly the same sentiments. If it is
too much to say that one will be loved and the other
hated, at least the balance will be unequal. Edward
had found means from the beginning to please his
patroness and relative. He had been&mdash;is not this
the grand reason?&mdash;so good: he had been ready at
her service when she wanted him, he had stayed at
home, he had been son and daughter to the lonely
woman. All that she knew of him was excellent,
and she had no reason to imagine there was anything
to know which was not equally good.</p>

<p>Catherine was one of the people who say that
they do not look for gratitude. If Edward had not
appreciated the kindness which picked him up as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
were from the roadside, she would but have laughed;
she would not have shown either surprise or pain;
but the fact that he did feel her kindness, and devote
himself to her, touched her deeply. She was as well
off as if he had been her son, far better off than
many mothers with sons. But Harry was very
different. For a long time she had made up her
mind that Harry was her great failure. He and his
sister had never attempted to attach themselves to
Catherine. They had considered their elevation to
the White House, and the honours of the bank, as
owing to their own merits, and had set up a sort of
heir-apparent establishment always in opposition.
With the natural instinct of a woman, she had
concluded it all to be Ellen's fault; but Harry had
not the good sense to separate himself from his
sister, or even to imply that he did not support her
in her proceedings: far from that, he stood by her
with the utmost loyalty. Though he never was
anything but deferential and respectful in his dull
way to his benefactress, he never would allow it to be
supposed that he did not approve of his sister and
back her up. If Catherine saw the merit of this
faithfulness, it was in a grudging way; and, as a
matter of fact, she did not like Harry. There was
nothing in reality to find fault with in him. He was
very steady at his business, notwithstanding the
rival claims of cricket in summer and football in
winter. And when he was asked to dinner at the
Grange, he was as punctual as clockwork, with an
expanse of shirt front that would have been a credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
to any man. But he did not please Catherine. He
had given her a reproof which stung, on that occasion
when he "took down" Mrs. John, without waiting to
know what person of importance should have gone
before. Nothing that could have been said would
have stung Catherine so much as that good-natured
act, and it was all the more hard upon her that in
her heart (always a good and generous one) she
approved Harry. It was a reproach to her, and still
more, it was a reproach to Edward, who had never
taken the slightest notice of Mrs. John's presence,
but left her among the neglected ones. Catherine
had been doubly angry with Harry ever since that
evening. She would not allow even that he was a
handsome fellow.</p>

<p>"He is big enough," she would say, resenting the
fact that he was a head taller than Edward, and
twice as strong. "He is a fine animal, if you like:
but I don't see how a man with white eyelashes
can be considered handsome."</p>

<p>Edward did not oppose his aunt in this any more
than in other things. "I allow," he would say, "that
he is not clever." But he shook his head, as one
who would deprecate a too true accusation when
Miss Vernon held Harry up to ridicule. "No, he is
not clever; he will never set the Thames on fire,"
Edward said.</p>

<p>Miss Vernon saw Harry pass the third time he
went to the Vernonry, and afterwards she looked for
him regularly. "Who was it for?" she asked, with
an ardent feminine appreciation of the only motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
which could induce a man to hurry over his dinner
and get to the Vernonry in time for the humble
community's tea. This was a question not very hard
to answer, seeing that the next moment she added to
herself, "Who else could it be?" It could not be
Matilda, or Martha, who were neither young nor fair.
It was very unlikely to be Mrs. Reginald, though she
was young enough, and not without beauty. "But
Harry is not the man to burden himself with a lot
of children," said Catherine, with an unnecessary
scoff at the poor fellow who was not her favourite.
Thus there was only one person whom it could be.
It gave her a sort of pang of amusement when she
concluded upon this&mdash;Hester! that proud, troublesome
creature&mdash;she who would never give in, who
put on the airs of a princess in the Grange drawing-room,
and declined to go to supper&mdash;she with the
spirit of a revolutionary, and the temper of a&mdash;demon&mdash;(no,
no, this was perhaps too bad&mdash;the
temper of a&mdash;Vernon, Catherine said to herself with
a laugh)&mdash;she to fall to the lot of Harry! This was
so strangely funny, so paradoxical, so out of character,
that it amused Catherine altogether beyond description,
yet gave her a strange blow. What a ridiculous
combination! If the world had been ransacked for
two who ought not to come together, these two
would be that pair. What would they do with each
other? how could they ever pull together&mdash;the one
all eagerness and vigour, the other stolid and heavy?
Catherine was almost tempted to be sorry for the
girl, but the next moment she laughed again. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
it was easy to understand! Mrs. John must have
managed it all. She would see in it a way of
recovering all her lost glories, of getting back her
footing in that ridiculous White House, which had
been adapted to her silly taste from the beginning.
Oh, no doubt it was her doing! She would talk
the girl over; she would persuade her into it, "with
a host of petty maxims preaching down a daughter's
heart." And it was with a gleam of vindictive
amusement that Catherine assured herself that Mrs.
John would find herself mistaken. After she had
made the marriage she would be left in the lurch.
Harry was not a man to put up with a mother-in-law.
Thus Catherine Vernon, though she was a clever
woman, misconceived and misunderstood them all.</p>

<p>But yet it did give her a natural pang. That girl,
who compelled her attention somehow, though she
had no favour for her&mdash;who inspired her with a certain
respect, notwithstanding the consistent opposition
to herself which Hester had always shown&mdash;to
think of that ambitious creature, all fire and life
being quenched in the dulness of Harry, put out in
the heavy tranquillity of his athletic existence&mdash;to
score at cricket matches, and spend long wearisome
days out in the sun, watching for the runs he got!
But then, she would be well off, would have the
White House and all sorts of good things. Oh, no
occasion to be sorry for her. She would get her
compensation. And then Catherine thought, with a
jealous displeasure which she felt angry with herself
for entertaining, of the arrangements which Harry's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
marriage would make necessary. Up to this time he
had more or less held his position at her pleasure, but
she had no reason, she was aware, to refuse to satisfy
all her engagements, and make him actually independent,
as he had been virtually for a long time back.
She would not have the slightest excuse for doing it.
Everything had gone on perfectly well. There were
no complaints of him at the bank. The business
flourished and made progress. But the thought that
Hester would be thus immediately placed on a sort
of equality with herself, and Mrs. John reinstated,
vexed her. It was a mean sentiment, but she could
not help it. It vexed her in spite of herself.</p>

<p>The news had been, it is scarcely necessary to say,
communicated to Edward at a very early stage. Miss
Vernon had called him to her, after dinner, as soon
as he came up stairs to the drawing-room, to the
window from which the road was visible winding
along the side of the Common to the Vernonry.</p>

<p>"Do you see that?" she said, pointing his cousin
out.</p>

<p>What? He saw the Common lying in all its
sweetness, its roughness and undulations standing
out in the level sunset rays, every bush casting a
shadow. He was young, and he had at least a
scientific love of nature, and longed to be out poking
into those beds of herbage, feeling the fresh air on
his face; and it was with a secret grudge in his
heart that he realised the difference between the
light, strong figure moving along buoyant with life
and liberty, and he himself in his evening clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
in his aunt's drawing-room, seeing it all from within
four walls.</p>

<p>"What?" he said, thinking that he would rather
not see the fair out-door evening world since he could
have no share in it. "Why&mdash;is it Harry?" and
then he felt that he hated the fellow who was his
own master.</p>

<p>"He is going a-wooing," Miss Vernon said.</p>

<p>She was sitting in her favourite place which commanded
this prospect, the Common, the Vernonry,
the tall pines, and the red bars of the sunset behind.
The sunset was her favourite entertainment, and in
summer she always sat here. Edward stood behind,
looking out over her head. She did not see the
grimace with which he heard these words. And he
did not reply for some time. It gave him a shock
more sharp even than that with which Catherine
herself had heard it first, though to be sure there
was no reason why.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said indifferently, "who can he find to
woo about here?" But he knew very well in his
heart what the answer would be.</p>

<p>"Only one person, so far as I can make out. It
must be that girl of Mrs. John's. I suppose she is
what you call pretty, though she has never been a
favourite of mine."</p>

<p>"But you can't confine prettiness to your favourites,
Aunt Catherine," said Edward, with a sharp
smile which he had sometimes.</p>

<p>"No, that's true. I deserved that you should hit
that blot. She is pretty I know. Poor Harry, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
will have his hands full, what with the mild mother
and the wild daughter. I wonder at the girl though.
She is an ambitious, energetic thing, and poor
dear Harry will never set the Thames on fire as
you say."</p>

<p>"Did I say it? No, I don't think he will; but he
has solid qualities."</p>

<p>"Very solid&mdash;the White House and his share in the
bank. Oh, there will be an equivalent! And to think
that little schemer, that soft little woman that looks
as if she could not harm a fly, should have managed
to secure herself in this cunning way and get her
daughter back to the point she started from! Who
would have thought it? There is nothing so astute
as simplicity."</p>

<p>Edward made no reply, and this was a thing Miss
Vernon did not like. She required a response.
Silence felt like disapproval, and as there was a
strong silent protest in her heart against everything
that was mean or petty in what she said,
she was apt to resent this want of acquiescence all
the more. She looked back at him when he did
not expect it, and was startled to see a look she
had never seen before, a look that astonished her,
on his face. It was something like a snarl of contempt
and despite, but it disappeared in a moment
and she could not believe her eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you so sure that Hester will marry him?"
was all that Edward said.</p>

<p>"Marry him! Why how could he have so much
as looked that way without encouragement? To be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
sure she will marry him. Where could she find any
one who had so much to offer? The girl is not a fool.
Besides, her mother would not let her if she wished
it; and of course she would not wish it, an ambitious
girl to whom her present position is intolerable. Don't
you remember her look on the Thursdays, which we
both remarked?"</p>

<p>Edward had remarked it, not exactly in the same
way as Catherine had done. Hester's look had made
him ashamed of himself, but he had not had the
strength to go and display himself by her side as
Harry had done. It made him furious to think of
Harry standing there by her in the corner, not caring
what their patroness might think. It was a courage
of which he was not capable.</p>

<p>"Don't you think," he said, softly, "that we are
going too fast, Aunt Catherine, in every way?
Harry's visit may be a chance one. There may be
no purpose at all in it, or it may have some other
purpose."</p>

<p>"He was there last night and on last Saturday and
Wednesday, and I don't know how many evenings
besides. Oh no, there can be no doubt on the subject.
It will be a great amusement for the Vernonry;
the dear old ladies want something to amuse
them."</p>

<p>This was said of the Ridgways and Mr. Mildmay,
who were all younger than Catherine, and one of
them a man. But that fact increased the pleasantry
all the more.</p>

<p>The curious thing was, that through all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Catherine was aware that what she was saying was
unworthy of her, and in reality was disgusted with
herself, and kept a mental reckoning of all the meannesses
of which she had been guilty. There were first
her remarks upon Mrs. John, which indeed might be
true enough, but which she ought not to have made;
and her certainty that scheming and "encouragement"
must have been used to entrap Harry, and
that Hester would marry him for an equivalent. No
moralist would have noted these faults more clearly
than she did herself, yet somehow she went on with
them all the same. But it vexed and annoyed her
to find Edward so constrained. He said, "Will you
come and have a turn in the garden?" but not in
his usual tone. That turn in the garden had been
doubly pleasant to her, because he had made it
appear that it was pleasant to him too.</p>

<p>"I think not to-night," she said.</p>

<p>"There is a new moon. It is a lovely evening,"
said he. "I think you ought to go. The sunset on
one side, and that clear, pale shining in the east on
the other, make such a beautiful contrast. Come,
Aunt Catherine, it will do you good."</p>

<p>"You think it will blow the ill-natured thoughts
out of my head," she said with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Have you ill-natured thoughts? I was not
aware of it," said Edward; and then as she did not
move he added&mdash;"If you will not come I think I
must go and give a little attention to some papers
I brought home with me. I had not time to look at
them during the day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"What papers?" she said quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, only some prospectuses and details about
investments," he said with a careless air, and left
her: to her great surprise.</p>

<p>He had been in the habit of telling her of any
work he had, all about it, and of sitting with her for
an hour or two at least. Catherine was surprised,
but as is natural in a first shock of this kind, having
got over the momentary prick of it, assured herself
that it was accidental and meant nothing: yet was
a little more vexed with <i>that</i> girl and with Harry,
because in the same way their concerns had brought
about this little, little break, this momentary lapse
in the continuance. She could not any longer amuse
herself with the prospect of the Vernonry, and the
little excitement of this dawning story. There were
a great many pricks about the story altogether,
sentiments and sensations of which, when left alone
and without the support of any moral backer up,
of Meredith's stimulating disclosures or Edward's
assent, she felt ashamed. It was wrong to speak as
she had done about the astuteness of Mrs. John's
simplicity. Why should not the mother wish to
place her child in the position which she, after all
by no fault of her own, poor creature! had lost?
Catherine escaped from the tingling of shame at her
own pettiness which had gone through her, by considering
the final arrangements which she would
have to make in view of Harry's marriage. Practically
she was always magnanimous; she would
have scorned a petty cutting off, a restraint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
liberality, a condition to her gifts. Her givings
were always large, and if her mind was warped by
the sense of benefactions unappreciated, or kindness
unprized, of reaping envy and resentment where she
should have got gratitude and love, was it not the
fault of her pensioners more than her own, the fault
of human nature, which she had been forced to
believe she saw through, and which&mdash;in order not
to break her heart over it&mdash;she was obliged to laugh
at and despise?</p>

<p>It would have given Catherine Vernon a sharper
shock still if she had seen into Edward's mind as he
went away from her, bitterly feeling that while other
men could taste the sweetness of freedom and of
love, he was attached to an old woman's apron-strings,
and had to keep her company and do her
pleasure, instead of taking the good of his youth
like the rest. It was a sudden crisis of this bitterness
which had made it impossible for him to bear
the yoke which he usually carried so patiently, and
which she, deceived in this instance, believed to be
pleasant to him, the natural impulse of a tranquil
and home-loving disposition. Had she known how
he regarded it, how violently he suppressed and
subdued himself, the shock would have been a
terrible one; for she was slow to put faith in those
around her, and she clung to the one who had been
able to impress her with a sense of trustworthiness,
with a double tenacity. Edward breathed more
freely when he got out of that drawing-room where
he always seemed so entirely at home. The library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
in which he sat when he was alone was a little less
oppressive in so far that he was alone in it, but the
recollection of Harry going lightly along in his freedom,
going a-wooing, had raised a ferment in the
breast of the other which it was very difficult to
quiet down. Since the morning when he made her
acquaintance first, Hester had been an interest to
the self-sufficing young man. Perhaps it was only a
little warmer than the interest he felt in his botany,
in a new specimen, but it had continued through
all those years. When he spoke that little aside to
her at the party, with his eyebrows and shoulders
in a suppressed and confidential attitude which
placed himself and her in the same category of compelled
assistants at a lugubrious merrymaking where
neither of them "got on"&mdash;he felt her in her poor
little muslin frock and her high indignation to be
far the most interesting person in the room, and
he resented the necessity which made it impossible
to him as the official host to separate himself from
the more important people, and show the opinion he
had of her. Here again the disabilities of his good
fortune weighed upon Edward. He was the host;
he was the first person there next to Catherine,
her representative, the master of all her wealth.
Harry was not of any authority in the house; so he
could do as he pleased, and earn the gratitude of
Hester; but Edward could neither go to her side in
her corner, nor set out of a lovely evening in his
pleasantest clothes to woo her, as a free man might.
He was not sure that he wanted to woo her, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
more than as a fine specimen; but he could not
bear the impudence of the other fellow who thought
himself good enough to go after her, and whom
Catherine thought so sure to win. Edward could
not contemplate with any self-possession the idea
that Harry might win. It made him angry, it made
him furious; it made him for the moment too much
a natural man, too sincere and real to be capable of
his usual self-suppression. Harry would have an
equal share with himself of the bank; they were
equal there in power and authority, and in the
profits they drew. Why then was it that Harry
should be his own master and Edward the slave of
an old woman! This was the utterance of his
passion, of the sincerity which was forced upon him
by the enticements of the summer night, the freedom
in the air, and the sight of all the privileges
which Harry exercised so easily without knowing
they were privileges at all. No doubt the fellow
thought himself good enough for Hester, perhaps
believed that she would jump at him, and was encouraging
him, and ready to accept his proffered
hand as soon as ever he should hold it out. This
thought made Edward's blood boil, and the confinement
of the Grange became so oppressive to him
that he did not know how to bear it. He indemnified
himself by plunging into the midst of the
bundle of papers which he had not chosen to
describe to Catherine. In these papers lay far more
excitement than all Harry's privileges had yet
supplied. A battery of artillery planted in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
this peaceful Grange with all its matches alight
would scarcely have been more full of danger.
There was enough in the packet to tear the house
up by its roots, and send its walls flying in a whirlwind
of ashes and ruin. Edward sat down to
examine it as another man might have flown to
brandy or laudanum. Dreams were in it of sudden
successes, of fortunes achieved in a moment. Castles
in the air more dazzling than ever rose in a fairy
tale. He revenged himself on his bonds, on the
superior happiness of his rival, on Catherine above
all, the unconscious cause of his imprisonment, by
this&mdash;Here was enough, all ready and in his hands,
to ruin them all.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<h3>HARRY'S VIEW.</h3>


<p>Of all the people who discussed his affairs and
were interested in his prosperity, Harry Vernon
himself would have agreed most entirely with
Catherine. He had no very elevated ideal either
of life in general or even of love, though that influenced
him at the present moment very powerfully.
He had got to be "very fond," as he would himself
have described it, of Hester. He thought her very
pretty to begin with, very delightful, attractive, and
amusing&mdash;the sort of girl with whom life never
would be dull. He thought her clever, one who
would be able to manage his now somewhat too
large and unwieldy house and take the trouble off
his hands; he thought that handsomely dressed, as
of course she would be, she would look very nice at
the head of his table and make it popular&mdash;better
even than Ellen had done: for in Ellen's time it had
been somewhat fast and noisy, more than Harry,
with the instincts of a respectable citizen and man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
business, felt to be advantageous, though he had
enjoyed it well enough. In all these particulars he
felt that his affections were leading him wisely, and
that not merely love&mdash;always avowedly more or less
folly&mdash;but discrimination and sense were in his
choice. But he would have thought Catherine
perfectly right about the advantages on Hester's
side, and he would not have been disgusted or
offended by the suggestion that Mrs. John had
schemed to place her daughter in the White House,
and done her best not to let such an eligible suitor
slip through her hands. And quite right too, he
would have said! He knew that he would be "a
catch" for Hester, and that as she was no fool, it
was inconceivable that she should not jump at him.
This idea did not offend him at all; that she should
marry him because he could give her rank which
otherwise she would not have, was a natural, sensible,
perfectly legitimate reason to Harry. Had there
been a rival in the field with greater things to offer,
he would have felt that he had a right to pause, to
think what was most to her advantage. But as
there was nobody, he thought probably that Hester
would be a great fool if she made any difficulty.
Catherine had offended herself and offended Edward
by her suggestion, but she would not have offended
Harry. "That is about it&mdash;that is the true state of
the case," he would have said. And it is possible that
he might have represented that notwithstanding the
fact that she had no money, Hester would not be
an altogether bad investment; for she had connections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Mrs. John might be a silly little woman, but
she was Sir John Westwood's cousin, and a little
more backing up from the county people would do
the Vernons no harm. Thus he took a very common-sense
view of the whole concern, thinking it
perfectly reasonable that Mrs. John should scheme,
and that Hester should consider the advantages.
He thought even that she had probably calculated
the uses of holding back, and that her expeditions
with the old captain, her disappearances at the time
of his own visits, were done with a distinct intention
of drawing a fellow on. It made him very angry,
especially as matters came to a crisis, to find her
absent, and only Mrs. John, very nervous and
apologetic, waiting for him when he went in: but
after the first bitterness of the disappointment, he
was ready to allow that it was good policy, and that
he was all the more anxious in the pursuit because
she thus played with him and kept him in uncertainty.
If Hester had but known that she was
supposed to be "drawing him on" by her absences!
but fortunately she did not know. And nothing
could have made them understand each other on
that point. They belonged to two different species,
and talked different languages. But the superficial
explanation which Catherine was ashamed of herself
for giving, and which Edward despised, would have
seemed quite natural to Harry, though in many
ways he was better than they were, and far more
true to his own system of morality. He neither hid
nor deceived, he did not cheat himself nor any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
else; and truth is so precious that even a low
matter-of-fact truth is better than half a falsehood,
however delicately and cleverly carried out. Harry
was all genuine throughout, not elevated in kind,
but never pretending to be what he was not. He
liked to think that he had a great many advantages
to bestow, and that the lady of his hopes had too
much good sense not to take these advantages into
consideration. This was different from wild impulse
and passion, which some people think finer things.
But Harry did not think so; he knew nothing indeed
about them. He considered that a man (and on the
other side perhaps an heiress) might "please his
fancy," in the first place, about his wife, before
thinking of other matters: but that the girl should
weigh the advantages, and strain a point to accept a
good offer, was as clear to him as daylight. It would
not in the smallest degree have vexed him to know
that his own claims were thus reasonably weighed.
He had the proud satisfaction of thinking that
Hester was not very likely to get such another offer;
and he felt sufficient confidence in her good sense
to be sure that this must have its just influence
upon her. Why should not it weigh with her?
She was "no fool." She could not but see on
which side the advantage lay.</p>

<p>The only thing was that he got tired of waiting
for the decision. He thought it unreasonable that
having so honourably and unequivocally displayed
his intentions, he should not be allowed to carry
them out. Summer began to wane and autumn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
come on, and yet he had never been able to speak
to the object of his affections. At last his patience
failed him altogether. He announced his mind to
Mrs. John almost with solemnity. "I can't go on
much longer," he said; "the servants worry me to
death. Ellen always took that sort of thing off my
hands. But I don't want Ellen to get in her nose
again and spoil my wife's chances when she does
come. The truth is, I should like to get married
before Christmas, if I am to be married at all. Why
should Hester hold me off and on? If she won't
have me, let her say so, and I can look elsewhere.
I don't think I should have much difficulty in
finding&mdash;" he concluded, his annoyance going off
in a half-smile of vanity as he caressed his light
moustache.</p>

<p>A shiver ran through Mrs. John. Before Christmas!
Even if Hester would consent at all, was it
possible that her reluctance could be overpowered so
soon, or that she should be made to acquiesce in
Harry's quite practical and matter-of-fact view.
"No doubt you want a lady in the house," she
said, sympathetically. "I am sure if I could be of
any use&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course you could be of use," said the
straightforward lover, "after we are married; but it
would be making a laughing-stock of ourselves if I
were to have you before. If there was any reason
for putting off I might wait, but I don't see any
reason. Once it's settled, we could make our
arrangements comfortably. It is being hung up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
like this from week to week which is such a
nuisance to me."</p>

<p>He went away that evening almost angry. What
was to be done? Mrs. John's natural instinct was
to "talk to" Hester; but she had learned by experience
that "talking to" is not a very effectual
instrument. All that she had been able to say had
been said, but without much apparent effect. She
had pointed out all the advantages. She had shown,
with tears in her eyes, what a change it would be&mdash;what
an unspeakable, delightful difference. Insensibly
to herself, Mrs. John had become eloquent
upon the charms, if not of Harry, at least of the
White House. But this had suddenly been brought
home to her by her remorseless child, who said
calmly, "Mother, if I could marry the house and
let you have it, I would do so in a moment," which
stopped Mrs. John's mouth.</p>

<p>"Marry the&mdash;house!" she said, with a surprised
cry.</p>

<p>"It is of the house you are talking. I know it
is nice&mdash;or at least I know you like it. I do not
care for it myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hester, my first married home!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I know. I wish I could get it for
you&mdash;on easier terms," the girl said, with a sigh.
And this was about all that ever came of talking
to her. She was very obstinate: and such a
strange girl.</p>

<p>But sometimes Providence, so much appealed
to&mdash;whom we upbraid for not furthering us and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
backing up our plans&mdash;suddenly did interfere. It
was entirely by chance, as people say. Mrs. John
had gone out of the room not two minutes before,
and Hester, who had been walking and had just
come in, stood before the old-fashioned dark mirror
which occupied the space between the windows,
arranging her hair, which had been blown about
by the wind. It was, as has been said, troublesome
hair&mdash;so full of curls that the moment it had a
chance it ran out of the level and orderly into rings
and twists, which were quite unfashionable in those
days. It had been loosened out by the wind, and
she was trying to coax it back into its legitimate
bondage, with her arms raised to her head, and her
back turned to the door. Harry came in without
knocking, and the first intimation Hester had that
the long-avoided moment had come, and that there
was no escape for her, was when she saw his large
form in the glass, close to her, looming over her, his
fair head above hers, looking down with admiration
and tenderness upon her image. She turned round
hastily, with a cry of astonishment, her rebellious
locks escaping from her hands.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't you let it stay so? It is very
pretty so," Harry said, looking at the curly mass
with a smile, as if he had a great mind to take a
lock of it in his fingers.</p>

<p>Hester sprang away from him, and twisted it up,
she did not know how.</p>

<p>"It is so untidy&mdash;there is so much wind." She
was angry with herself for apologising. It was he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
who ought to have apologised. She pushed the hair
away behind her ears, and got it fastened somehow.
"I did not hear you knock," she said.</p>

<p>"I fear I didn't knock. The verandah door
was open. I saw nobody about. I did not know
whether I should find any one. You are so often
out now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I walk with old Captain Morgan about this
time. In the morning I am always at home."</p>

<p>"If I had known that I should have come in the
morning," he said, "not regularly because of the
bank, but I should have come once to see you.
However, this is far better. I am so glad to find
you. I have wished for this for months past. Has
it never occurred to you that I was anxious to see
you, Hester? You looked to me as if you were
keeping away."</p>

<p>"Why should I keep away? I do always the
same thing at the same hour. Captain Morgan is
old&mdash;he requires to have somebody with him."</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;I am young, and I want somebody
with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, it does not matter about young people,"
Hester said.</p>

<p>"I think it matters most of all, because they
have their life before them; and, don't you know,
the choice of a companion tells for so much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A companion!&mdash;oh, that is quite a different
question," said Hester. "It is teaching I have
always wanted, never a companion's place."</p>

<p>"I have heard of that," said Harry. "When you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
were quite a little thing you wanted to teach, and
Aunt Catherine would not let you. You&mdash;teaching!
It would have been quite out of the question.
Won't you sit down? Do come for once, now that
I have found you, and sit down here."</p>

<p>It was the little old-fashioned settee that was
indicated, where there was just room for two.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have got things to do!" cried Hester,
in alarm. "My mother will be here immediately,
but I&mdash;have got something up stairs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Always when I come," he said. "Just once,
because I am here, listen to me, Hester. It won't
take very long. I think you use me very ill. You
know I come here for you, and you will never let
me see you. And now when I find you by chance,
you insist that you have something to do. Leave
it till to-morrow. Perhaps after to-morrow," said
Harry, in a lugubrious voice, "I may not be
coming any more."</p>

<p>"Is anything to happen to-morrow?" said Hester,
betrayed by his seeming gravity.</p>

<p>Then Harry cheered up again, and became more
at his ease.</p>

<p>"Not," he said, "if something should happen
to-night. That's what I wish&mdash;that something
should happen now. Sit down, please, and listen.
Don't you know, Hester&mdash;they say women always
know&mdash;that I've been in love with you ever so
long?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know anything about it," said
Hester, though a sudden flush came over her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>She had seated herself on the sofa in a kind of
desperation, fearing that he meant to place himself
beside her. And such had been Harry's intention;
but some dim sense of fitness moved him to depart
from this portion of his programme. He stood
before her instead, looking down upon her, feeling
now that he had it all in his own hands.</p>

<p>"It is true, though. What do you suppose I have
been coming here for every night? I <i>think</i> I've
been in love with you ever since I first saw you&mdash;when
you were only a child. Now I'm alone since
my sister is married, and quite free to choose where
I like. He made a pause, but Hester did not say
anything. She sat drawing patterns upon the
carpet with her foot, listening&mdash;because she could
not help it. She who was so full of eagerness and
life, it seemed to Harry as if every line of her figure
expressed the listlessness of a subject that wearied
her. Now this was more than a fellow could stand,
although even now he felt that it drew him on.
"By Jove!" he cried, "one would think you were
getting offers every day of your life."</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a brightening
countenance.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "If this is an offer, Cousin
Harry, it is the first I have ever had."</p>

<p>"And you think no more of it than that!" he
cried, with most natural feeling, flinging himself
down in a low wicker-work chair at her feet, so
that he made it shake and tremble. This restored
Hester once more to herself. She began to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
amused, which, in the dull life she was leading,
told for so much.</p>

<p>"How should I take it? I don't know, indeed,
for I never was in the circumstances before. It is
true I have read about it in books," said Hester,
considering. "A girl in a novel would say that it
was a great honour you had done her, Cousin
Harry," for he showed signs of natural impatience,
jumping up and pacing noisily about the room.
"Don't you see it is very difficult. You make a
statement to me about your own state of mind,
and then you look as if you expected something
from me; but what am I to say? I am not in love
with you&mdash;or anybody," Hester added quietly, as if
by an after-thought.</p>

<p>He was coming towards her, with his lips apart
ready to speak; but this quiet little additional word
seemed to stop in a moment what he was going to
say. He did not quite know how, nor did she know,
whether she meant anything by it; but it had an
immediate effect. He gave a gasp as if those
arrested words almost choked him, then said, "Nor
anybody?" suddenly. It had seemed certain to him
before that: she never could have seen any one,
and she had informed him that this was her first
"offer"; nevertheless he took these words&mdash;having
them thrown at him, as it were, in a surprise&mdash;as
a great concession. He drew a long breath,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then, Hester, there is the more chance for me."</p>

<p>Thus in a moment their relative positions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
changed. Harry had begun by feeling that he had
a great deal to bestow&mdash;many things which no girl
in her senses could neglect or reject. But in a
moment he had been reduced to what in chivalry
should be a lover's only standing-ground, the right
of telling his love with or without response, waiting
absolutely upon his lady's pleasure, hoping for her
bounty&mdash;no more. He was so carried away by this
new impulse that he did not understand himself,
or the change worked in him; but with a gasp as
for breath, turned from the nineteenth-century
version of love-making to the primitive one, not
knowing what he did.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Hester. "Perhaps; I
cannot tell. I don't know anything about it; and,
if I must tell you the truth, Cousin Harry, I don't
wish to know. It seems to me that all that is silly
between you and me. You can come here as often
as you like: my mother is always glad to see you.
We are all very good friends. What advantage do
you think there would be in turning everything
upside down&mdash;in making a great fuss and disturbance
and changing all our relations? I cannot see
what object there is in it. I think we are much
better to stay as we are."</p>

<p>"But I don't think so," said Harry stoutly. "If
you're going to argue about it, I never was good at
that sort of thing, and you might easily beat me.
But <i>I</i> don't think so. I don't care about being good
friends. I want you to belong to me, to live with
me, you and your mother too. Why! we might go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
on as we are doing for a hundred years, and we never
could be of any use to each other&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Hester stopped him with raised hand and
gesture. "Oh, yes, a great deal of use. To be
friends is about the best thing in the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not half so good," cried Harry, "as being man
and wife! My house might all be at sixes and sevens,
and you could not help me to manage it, living here;
and you would never let me be of any use to you.
Don't you see? if we were married I could give
you everything you wanted, it would be natural. We
should get on together, I know. I should never
grudge you anything, and your mother could come
back to her old home, and I should see to her comfort
too. Whereas here, living as we are, what can I
do?&mdash;or you for me?" said Harry. "Ah! that's all
nonsense about being friends. It isn't your friend
I want to be."</p>

<p>"What you say is very curious to me," said Hester.
"There is a great deal that is very fine in it, Cousin
Harry. To offer to give me all that is very nice of
you, and I should like to help you to manage your
house. I have often thought I should like to try&mdash;very
likely I should not succeed, but I should like
to try."</p>

<p>"It is the easiest thing in the world," he said with
a smile that was tender, and touched Hester's heart.
"As soon as ever you marry me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the preliminary is just what I don't like,"
said Hester. "I would rather not marry&mdash;any one.
I don't see the need for it. We are very well as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
are, but we don't know what a new state of things
might do for us."</p>

<p>"I know," said Harry, "what it would do for me.
It would make me very happy and comfortable at
home, which I am not now. It would settle us both
in life. A young fellow is thought nothing of till he
is married. He may go off to the bad at any time,
he may take a wrong turn; and in business he is
never relied upon in the same way. When he has a
wife he has given hostages to society, they say&mdash;that
is what it would do for me. Except being richer and
better off, and able to make your mother comfortable,
and so forth, I can't say, of course, what it would do
for you."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," she said gravely. "All these
things would be very good: but it might make me
into something I shouldn't like. I feel afraid of it.
I have no inclination to it, but all the other way."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Harry, which was an exclamation
he never used save when very hard bested, "that
is not very complimentary to me."</p>

<p>"Did you wish me to pay you compliments? No;
we are arguing out the general question," said
Hester, with her serious face.</p>

<p>Harry was at his wits' end with impatience and
provokedness, if we may use such a word. He could
have seized her with his hands and shaken her, and
yet, all the time, he was still conscious that this
strange treatment drew a fellow on.</p>

<p>"I suppose all this means that you won't have
me?" he said, after a pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think so, Cousin Harry. I am not satisfied
that it would do us any good; but don't rush away
in a temper," she said, laying her hand lightly on
his arm. "Don't be vexed; why should you? I
don't mean to vex you. If I don't see a thing in the
same light as you do, that is no reason why you
should be angry."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Harry again, "if a man is not
to be vexed when he's refused, I wonder what you
think he's made of?&mdash;not flesh and blood."</p>

<p>"Sense," said Hester, "and kindness. These are
things you are made of, whether you are angry or not."</p>

<p>She had risen up, and stood looking at him, as he
turned round hastily and made for the door; but this
flattery (if it was flattery) stopped him. He turned
round again and stood looking at her, tantalised,
provoked, soothed, not knowing what to say.</p>

<p>"If you think all that of me, why won't you
have me?" he said, stretching out wistful hands
towards her.</p>

<p>Hester shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't want to have&mdash;any one," she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. John had been listening on the stairs. Not
listening&mdash;she was too far off to hear a word&mdash;but
waiting for the indications which a step, a sound of
movement, the opening of a door, might give. The
stair was an old oaken one at the end of the passage,
hidden in the evening dimness; dark at any time
even in the day. When the door did open at last,
though it did so with a little jar as from an agitated
hand, yet two voices came out, and the sound of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
conversation was not angry, nor like that of people
who had quarrelled. But, on the other hand, it was
not low like the talk of lovers; and Mrs. John
could not conceive it possible that if he had been
accepted Harry would have left the house without
seeing her. That was impossible. Either nothing
had been said on the subject, or else&mdash; But what
else? She was confounded, and could not tell what
to think. Hester went out with him to the verandah
door. It was she who did most of the talking.
She called out to him something that sounded like
"Don't be long of coming back," as he went out.
Mrs. John by this time had hurried out of the staircase,
and rushed to a window whence she could see
him departing. He turned round and waved his
hand, but he also shook his head with a look more
completely lover-like than Mrs. John had yet seen
him cast at her child. It was full of tender reproach,
yet pleasure, disappointment, but also something that
was far from despair. "It is all very well for you to
say so," he said. What did it mean? Mrs. John
hurried down when he had disappeared, tingling with
curiosity and anxiety. She found Hester sitting in
the twilight quite unoccupied, her hands in her lap,
her eyes gazing straight before her. Nothing could
be more unlike her usual dislike to idleness. She
was lying back on the settee, thinking, not even
asking for lights. Mrs. John stole to her in the
gathering darkness and gave her a sudden kiss. The
mother was tremulous and shaken, the daughter
very calm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Hester! what has happened? Have you
accepted him?" said Mrs. John: "have you refused
him? What has been going on? Now it is over,
you might let me know."</p>

<p>"I am just trying to think, mother," Hester said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<h3>WHAT EDWARD THOUGHT.</h3>


<p>The day after this interview, which had excited
everybody, and which, not only Mrs. John, but the
chorus of attentive neighbours had felt in their
hearts to be of the most critical importance, Hester
had, as happened sometimes, a commission from her
mother&mdash;or rather, as she was the active housekeeper
and agent in all their business, a necessity of her
own, which took her into Redborough. Mrs. John had
been brought up in the age when girls were supposed
to be charming and delightful in proportion as they
were helpless, and her residence abroad had confirmed
her in the idea that it was not becoming, or
indeed possible, to permit a young woman "of our
class" to go anywhere alone. But what was it
possible for the poor lady to do! She could not
herself walk into Redborough, a distance which was
nothing in the estimation of the young and energetic.
All that Mrs. John was capable of, was to bemoan
herself, to wring her hands, and complain how dreadfully
things were changed, how incapable she herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
would have been of going anywhere unaccompanied&mdash;all
which galled, almost beyond endurance, the
high spirit of Hester, whose proud consciousness of
perfect capacity to guard herself wherever she choose
to go, was yet so much embittered by the tradition
of her mother's prejudice, that her expeditions,
harmless as they were, always appeared to her as a
sort of confession of lowliness and poverty, and
defiance of the world's opinion. Thus she moved
swift and proud about the streets, looking neither to
the right hand nor the left, with a half-shame, half-scorn
of her unprotectedness, which mingled oddly
with her indignant contempt of the idea of wanting
protection at all. No messenger ever went so
quickly, or returned so soon as Hester, under this
double inspiration. She skimmed along with "that
springy motion in her gait," as straight and as light
as an arrow; and before the chorus of the Vernonry
had finished communicating to each other the exciting
fact that Mrs. John had once more permitted
<i>that</i> girl to go into town by herself, and asking each
other what she could expect was to come of such
proceedings&mdash;Hester would walk back into the midst
of their conclave with such a consciousness of all
their whisperings in the large eyes with which she
contemplated them as she passed to her mother's
door, as suddenly hushed and almost abashed the
eager gossips.</p>

<p>"She can't have been in Redborough," Miss
Matilda would say breathless when the girl disappeared.
"Nobody could go so quickly as that. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
has never been there at all. Dear Mrs. John, how
she is taken in! She must have had some appointment,
some rendezvous, there can't be any doubt
of it."</p>

<p>"You know best, ladies, how such things are
managed," Mr. Mildmay Vernon would say with his
acid smile, which was like a doubled-edged weapon,
and cut every way.</p>

<p>This was the usual course of affairs. But on this
particular day she did not surprise them in their
animadversions by her rapid return. She was as
long as an ordinary mortal. It was already afternoon
when she set out, and the early autumn
twilight had almost begun when she returned home.
The weather was no longer warm enough to permit
of those hostile meetings in the summer-house where
the Vernonry disputed and fraternised. They were
all indoors, looking out&mdash;Miss Matilda seated in her
window, with her work-table displayed, Mr. Mildmay
making himself uncomfortable at the only angle of
his which commanded the gate, to watch for the
girl's return. If Harry accompanied her back the
community felt that this would be certain evidence
as to what had happened; but they were still full
of hope that Harry had not been such a fool. It
strung up their nerves to the highest pitch of
suspense to have to wait so long, especially as it
was evident that Mrs. John too was exceedingly
nervous about her daughter's delay. She was seen
to go out, at least twice, with a shawl over her cap,
to look out along the road, and twice to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
disappointed. What was she anxious about? Very
good cause she had to be anxious with a girl like
<i>that</i>, wandering no one could tell where about the
streets! And where could she be? and whom could
she be with? Of course things could not go on like
this; it must come to light sooner or later; for the
credit of the family it ought not to be allowed to
go on. This was what the chorus said.</p>

<p>In the meantime Hester had done her business as
quickly as usual, but on her return she had found
herself waylaid. Edward, with whom her intercourse
had been so broken, who had established
himself on the footing of a confidential friend on the
first day of her arrival, and at intervals when they
had met by chance since then, had spoken and
looked as if this <i>entente cordiale</i> had never been
disturbed&mdash;Edward was lingering upon the edge of
the Common on this particular afternoon on his way
home apparently, though it was early. It would be
difficult to explain Hester's feelings towards him.
He piqued her curiosity and her interest beyond any
one of the limited circle with which the girl had
to do. There were times when her indignation at
the contrast between his fraternal and almost tender
accost on their accidental meetings, and the way in
which he held himself aloof on more public occasions,
was uncontrollable; but yet there rarely
occurred any of these public occasions without a
meaning look, a word said in an undertone which
conveyed to Hester a curious sense of secret intimacy,
of having more to do with Edward's life than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
any of the fine people among whom he was so much
more visibly familiar. She was young enough to
have her imagination excited, and kept in a state
of tantalised interest by these tactics, and also to
be indignant by any suggestion that this mode of
treatment was not honourable on his part. Not
honourable! The idea would have roused Hester
into proud indignation. What was he to her that it
should matter how he behaved? His blowing hot
and cold, his holding off and on, which a moralist
would have condemned summarily, which the gossips
would have delighted in commenting upon, what was
it to her? But it amused her in the meantime with
a constant curiosity and frequent pique, exercising
over her imagination something of the same effect
which her own waywardness had upon Harry, when
he declared that it drew a fellow on. When she got
out of the streets, and saw before her walking slowly,
as if waiting for some one, the figure of this tantalising
and uncertain personage, there was a slight
quickening of Hester's pulses and flutter at her
heart. He had never done anything of this kind
before, and she had a feeling that he had not waited
for her for nothing, but that some further revelation
must be at hand.</p>

<p>"I saw you from my office-window," he said. "I
never saw any one walk like you. I know you at
once at any distance, even in a crowd. Do you
dislike so much walking alone?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?" she asked quickly. "I always
walk alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is no answer. One may hate many things
one has to do habitually. Your walk says that you
dislike it. It says, Here am I, who ought to be
guarded like a princess; but I am poor, I have no
escort of honour; yet here I walk, a whole retinue,
a body-guard to myself."</p>

<p>Hester's colour changed from pale to red, and from
red to pale, with mingled indignation and pleasure.
It occurred to her, against her will, that Harry might
have seen her pass for years without learning anything
from her gait.</p>

<p>"I have to be my own body-guard, it is true,"
she said; "but why should I want one at all?
It is folly to suppose a girl requires protection
wherever she goes. Protection! who would harm
me?" she cried, lighting up with an almost angry
glow.</p>

<p>"I for one should not like to try," said Edward,
looking at her, with a look which was habitual to
him when they were alone. What did it mean? A
sort of contemplative regretful admiration as of a
man who would like to say a great deal more than
he dared say&mdash;a sort of, "if I might," "if I could,"
with an element of impatience and almost anger in
the regret. There was a pause, and then he resumed
suddenly, and without any preface, "So it is Harry&mdash;who
is to be the man?"</p>

<p>"Harry!" Hester gasped, suddenly stopping
short, as she had a way of doing when anything
vexed or disturbed her. The rapidity of the attack
took away her breath. Then she added, as most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
people, and certainly every girl naturally would add,
"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Who else?" said Edward, calmly. "He has
his freedom and he knows how to use it. And I
approve him, for my part. I am of the same opinion.
It should be I, if I were he."</p>

<p>It seemed to Hester that all the blood in her
rushed to her throbbing cheeks and aching forehead.
She stamped her foot on the ground.</p>

<p>"Is it of me you dare to speak so?" she cried.
"Oh, I understand you! When one has been
brought up among the Vernons, one knows what
things mean. You venture to tell me that Harry is
the man!&mdash;who else?&mdash;but that you would have
been so had you been free&mdash;the man," cried the girl
with blazing eyes, that smote him with lightnings
not of a harmless kind, "to pick up out of the dust&mdash;me!&mdash;like
something on the roadside."</p>

<p>"You are very eloquent, my little cousin," said
Edward, "not that there is very much in what you
say; but your looks and gesture are as fine as ever
I saw. After all though, is it called for? When I
say that Harry is the man, I do not suppose either
that he is worthy of you, or that you think so; but
you are a girl, what can you do? They would not
let you work, and if you could work, nothing but
daily bread would come of it. And, my dear Hester,
you want a great deal more than daily bread. You
want triumph, power; you want to be as you are
by nature, somebody. Oh, yes," he said, going on
quietly, waving his hand to avert the angry interruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
which was on her lips; "believe me it is so,
even if you don't know it. And how can you do
this, save by marrying? It does not make anything
worse to recognise its real character. You must do
this by marrying. Harry is the first man who offers.
If you were to wait a little longer you might do
better; but you do not feel that you can wait. I
do not blame you. I should do the same were
I you."</p>

<p>All this was said very quietly, the speaker going
on by her side with his eyes turned to the ground,
swinging his stick in a meditative way. The soft
measure of his voice, with little pauses as if to
mark the cadence, exercised a sort of spell upon
the girl, who with passion in all her veins, and a
suffocating sense of growing rage, which made her
almost powerless, and took away words in the very
heat of her need for them&mdash;moved on too against
her will, feeling that she could express herself only
by tones of fury if she attempted to express herself
at all.</p>

<p>"Money does it all," said Edward, in the same
meditative way. "I am supposed to have as much
as he has, but I am tied to an old woman's apron,
and would lose everything were I to venture like he.
Why should he be free and I a slave? I know no
reason. Caprice&mdash;chance, made it so. He might
have been taken in at the Grange, and I at the
White House. Then I should have been the man,
and he been nowhere. It is just so in life. Nothing
but money can set it right. Money does. You can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
believe in Providence when you have money. I shall
get it some day; but so far as this goes, I shall be
too late. For you, there are compensations," he
said, giving a little glance at her. "You will find
him very manageable&mdash;more manageable than many
who would have suited you better&mdash;than myself for
instance. I should not have been docile at all&mdash;even
to you&mdash;but he will be. You can do what
you please with him; there is compensation in
all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cousin Edward," said Hester, suddenly finding
her voice, "you told me just now that I disliked to
walk alone, that I was poor and had no body-guard.
I said, who would harm me? but you have proved
that it was true, and I a fool. I did want a body-guard,
some one to see that I was not insulted, to
protect me, on a quiet country road, from&mdash;from&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes? from&mdash;whom? an unsuccessful suitor: a
man that always has a right to be insulting," cried
Edward with a sort of laugh, "to relieve his mind.
True! to be sure all these things are true. It is
quite right that a girl needs protection. Men are
stronger than she is, and they will insult her if it is
in their power, if not in one way then in another.
The weak will always go to the wall. If there is
nobody to take care of you, and nobody to punish me
for it, of course I shall treat you badly. If I am not
any worse than my neighbours I don't pretend to be
any better. Do you think I should have waited for
you to-night if I had not wanted to insult you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
because you were alone and unprotected and unfriended,"
he said, with a sort of snarl at her, turning
upon her with a fierce sneer on his face.</p>

<p>Hester was struck with a horror which stopped her
indignation in full career. "Oh," she cried, "how can
you make yourself out to be so ignoble, so
ungenerous! even when you say it I cannot believe
it; to insult me cannot be what you mean."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he said, looking at her, "you can't
do anything to me. For your own sake you will tell
nobody that Edward Vernon met you and&mdash;said
anything that he ought not to have said. Besides,
if you wished to ruin me with <i>her</i>," he waved his
hand towards the Grange as he spoke, "in the first
place she would not believe you, in the second place
if it came to that I should not much mind. It would
be emancipation anyhow; I should be no longer a
slave bound to follow a woman, in chains. If I lost
in one way, I should gain in another. But I am
safe with you," he said with another laugh; "I am
free to irritate you, to outrage you as much as I
please; you will not complain: and in that case why
should not I take it out of you?" he cried, turning
fiercely upon her.</p>

<p>Hester was too much startled to retain the violent
indignation and offence of her first impulse. She
was overwhelmed with pity and horror.</p>

<p>"Cousin Edward," she said, "you do not mean
all that. You did not come here to insult me. You
must have had some other thought. You must be
very unhappy somehow, and troubled, and distressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
to speak as you are doing now. It comes out of
yourself, it is not anything about me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is something about you," he said
with a laugh. Then after a pause, "But you have
some insight all the same. No. I'll tell you what
it is; it is money, money, Hester&mdash;that is what we
all want. If you had it you would no more marry
Harry than old Rule; if I had it&mdash;&mdash;And the thing
clear is that I must have it," said Edward, breaking
off abruptly. "I can't wait."</p>

<p>Hester went home very much bewildered, outraged
by all he said, yet more sorry than angry.
He had not made any reply to her appeal for his
confidence, yet she knew that she was right&mdash;that it
was out of a troubled and miserable heart that he
had spoken, not merely out of wounded feeling on
the subject of herself. She did not know whether he
understood what she said to him on the subject of
Harry, or if that penetrated his mind at all; but she
went home at once more miserable and more interested
than she thought she had ever been in her life.
Had not she too drawn some conclusion of the same
kind from her own experiences, from the atmosphere
of the Vernonry so full of ingratitude, unkindness,
and all uncharitableness? She came very slowly
home, and took no notice of the way in which
Mildmay Vernon squinted at her from his corner,
and the Miss Ridgways waved their hands from the
window. Harry then had not come home with her.
"I knew he was not such a fool," the male observer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
said to himself, and the sisters laughed and talked in
quite an outburst of gaiety for some time after.
"Harry Vernon think of <i>that</i> girl! of course he did
not. Who would? so ill brought up, with such
manners, and hair that is nearly red," they said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<h3>WALKS AND TALKS.</h3>


<p>"They tell me you are to be congratulated,
Hester," said old Captain Morgan.</p>

<p>She had met him taking his evening walk, and
in that and in his aspect altogether there was
something altogether despondent&mdash;a depression and
air of weakness which was not common with the
old man. She had not gone with him for some
days, and perhaps he had felt the desertion. The
first thing Hester did was to draw his hand within
her arm.</p>

<p>"You are tired," she said.</p>

<p>"Not very. I am a silly old fellow and always go
too far. I have been thinking of you, my dear; and
if you are to be congratulated&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; I don't think so, Captain Morgan. What
about?"</p>

<p>"About&mdash;&mdash; If anything so important had
happened you would have come and told me,
Hester."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad you see that at last. But yes, there
is something to congratulate me upon. Nothing did
happen. Is not that a great deal to say? For I
was tempted, sadly tempted."</p>

<p>"My dear, I don't understand that."</p>

<p>Hester laughed.</p>

<p>"You see, Captain Morgan, you are wise and know
a great deal; but you were never a girl&mdash;and a poor
girl. It would have been so delightful to put my
mother back in her nice house, and show Catherine&mdash;&mdash;"
Here she paused somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>"What of Catherine?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, not much&mdash;they were, perhaps, when they
were young&mdash;on different sides. My mother has
come down, and Cousin Catherine has gone up. I
should like to have put the balance straight."</p>

<p>"To bring Catherine down, and put your
mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Captain Morgan. Catherine is always good
when she is with you. I think I almost like her
<i>then</i>. I would not harm her," said Hester, holding
up her head, "if I had the power to do it. But she
scorns every one of us; perhaps because we all
consent to eat her bread. I would not, you know,
if I could help it."</p>

<p>"I know you are ungenerous, Hester, in that
respect."</p>

<p>"Ungenerous! Well, never mind, there are more
kinds of ungenerosity than one. I am going in with
you to tell Mrs. Morgan."</p>

<p>"I am not sure," said the old captain, "though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
is a wretched piece of self-denial, that I want you
to come with me to-night."</p>

<p>Hester opened her great eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Why!" she said. It was the one house in the
world to which she felt she had a right.</p>

<p>"That is nonsense, however," said the old man;
"for of course you must meet. We have got our
grandson, Hester."</p>

<p>"I heard somebody had come, but I thought it
was a gentleman. I did not know you had any&mdash;children&mdash;except
little Mary."</p>

<p>"We have none&mdash;in this world; but do you think
my wife would have been what she is with never a
child? We all have our disabilities, my love. I
have never been a young girl, and you have never
been an old&mdash;pair."</p>

<p>They both laughed. Hester with the easily-recovered
cheerfulness of youth, he in tremulous
tones, which had as much pathos as mirth in them.</p>

<p>"This is the son of my daughter," he said. "She
has been long dead, poor girl&mdash;happily for her.
Unless when there is some business connected with
them to be settled we don't talk much of them.
My wife and I long ago went back to the honeymoon
stage. We have had to live for each other: and
very glad to have each other to live for. Children
are very strange, my dear."</p>

<p>"Are they?" said Hester, with an awe which she
could scarcely understand.</p>

<p>"Very strange. So dependent upon you for long,
so independent after; so unlike you, that you cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
understand what you have to do with them. Perhaps
it is a penalty of living so long as we have done.
I have a theory," said the old captain, cheering up,
"that after seventy, when you have lived out your
life, you begin another. And it is quite different.
It is a pity we can't renew the old bodies&mdash;eyes
and ears and legs and all the rest of it. It would
be a very interesting experiment."</p>

<p>"Like the people who found the elixir of life, or
the Wandering Jew?"</p>

<p>The girl spoke to humour him, herself wondering
over every word with that curiosity, mingled with
pity and tenderness and half disapproval, with which
youth listens to the vagaries of age.</p>

<p>"Not at all like the Wandering Jew; his life was
continuous and one-ideaed," said Captain Morgan,
delighted to get upon his hobby. "And I miss a
great deal in the stories of those who get the elixir.
They may renew their lives but not themselves.
There is one I recollect at this moment, St. Leon.
Of course you have never read St. Leon. He
becomes a beautiful young man, and the rival of his
son, who, of course, does not know him. But the
old fellow knows <i>him</i>. He is an old fellow notwithstanding
his elixir; the soul of him is just the same.
That is not my point of view."</p>

<p>The old man had become quite erect and walked
smartly, animated by his fancy, leading Hester with
him rather than leaning on her.</p>

<p>"No," he repeated, "that is not at all my point of
view. The bodies keep old, the minds get&mdash;different.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
I have shaken off my old burdens. I don't take
any more responsibility for those who&mdash;used to
belong to me. They don't belong to me any longer.
They are labouring along in the former life. I have
started in the new."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Morgan?" said Hester, with a quaver
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Ah! there's the blot," said the old man. "Of
course, she and I belong to each other for ever and
ever. Oh, I don't want to begin again without my
old wife; and she won't give up the children,
though they are children no longer. Once a mother,
always a mother, Hester. You women are sadly
fettered&mdash;you can't shake it off."</p>

<p>"Nor you either, Captain Morgan!" cried Hester,
indignant. She could not bear that he should
so wrong himself.</p>

<p>"My dear, I could do it&mdash;without difficulty. Is
it just, do you think, that one human creature
should be made the victim of another, simply because
he has been instrumental in bringing that other into
the world? Supposing that they have drained all
that was best in me out of me for years? Supposing
that they have made my life hard and bitter to me?
Supposing that they have grown alien to me in every
respect&mdash;thinking other thoughts, walking in other
ways? And that they are as old and more worldly
than I am&mdash;older, less open to any influence of nature&mdash;am
I to go treating these old rigid commonplace
people as if they were my children still, and breaking
my heart about them? No; no."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>This seemed a terrible speech to Hester. She kept
patting his arm softly with her hand, and saying, "Oh,
Captain Morgan! You do not mean that!" again and
again. It was dreadful that he should say this. A
father to give up his children! It hurt Hester to
think that such an idea could find entrance into
any mind.</p>

<p>"And as for the grandchildren, that is out of the
question altogether," Captain Morgan said; "I am
not going to begin a new life of trouble through
them."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Hester, "that fathers and
mothers never could forget their children&mdash;it is in
the Bible."</p>

<p>"'Can a woman forget?' It is a woman, my
dear. There is nothing about a man. My wife is
horrified at what I say, as much as you are. But
for all that there is justice in everything, and one
soul should not be sacrificed for another. Well,
will you come in? I do not forbid you; but don't
take much notice, I warn you, Hester, of the person
you are going to meet."</p>

<p>The person she was going to meet! This was
enough to make her curious, if not prepossess her in
favour of the unknown, who, however, she expected
to be introduced to her in the shape of a schoolboy&mdash;perhaps
a heavy schoolboy&mdash;a sort of being for
whom the girl had an instinctive dislike. She followed
the old captain into the house almost mechanically.
Mrs. Morgan's chair, now that it began to be
chilly in the evenings, was placed so as to approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the fire, which in the evening was now always
lighted, and sent out a cheerful glow. It was more
cheerful than usual to-night, coming in from the grey
of the waning light outside. There was no lamp,
but only the leaping flame of the fire. The sound
of cheerful voices in conversation, even of laughter,
was audible as the door was opened. The quiet in
which the old lady generally sat waiting for her husband's
return&mdash;a tranquillity which was peace itself,
yet a silent peacefulness&mdash;had always seemed very
sweet to Hester. That soft stillness of waiting had
seemed to her the very atmosphere of love; but now
at the door, even before she entered, she was conscious
of a difference. Life had entered in. The voices
were not forced or measured, but chiming with each
other in the free interchange of familiar affection:
the old lady's soft little laugh enticing a louder
laughter; her voice alternating with the deeper tones.
There was no pause in this lively conversation; but
some one rose up against the firelight&mdash;a tall, straight
figure, no schoolboy, as was evident at the first glance&mdash;when
they went in. But, indeed, the first glance
was not supported by any further revelation, for
after the little commotion occasioned by their
entrance, the stranger subsided into his chair again,
and remained to Hester, till her departure, a shadow
only, with a singularly soft and harmonious voice. It
got up again to bow to her. And it went on talking,
out of the gloom, as she, sitting in the full glare of
the light, kept shyly by Mrs. Morgan's side. Why
was she shy? It was not her disposition to be shy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
This evening a gentle embarrassment was upon her.
She had a pleasure in sitting there by the old lady's
side, defended by the darkness from all necessity of
saying anything, sharing, she could scarcely tell why,
the content which trembled in every tone of her old
friend's voice. The captain did not take any share
in this talk. He sat down behind backs, saying that
the fire was too much for him, with a long-drawn
breath that sounded like a sigh. Once or twice he
was appealed to by name, and made a brief response;
but he took no part in the conversation. On ordinary
occasions it was he who talked, Mrs. Morgan in her
great chair remaining quietly quiescent, now and then
making a remark. It was very strange to see the
captain thrown thus into the background; but,
curiously enough, Hester did not remark it, so much
was she occupied with the novelty of the conversation.
When the door opened she was alarmed lest it
should be the lights that were coming, so much more
satisfactory was it to let things remain as they were.
The unseen speaker talked about a great many things
altogether unknown to Hester&mdash;his brothers and
sisters, his cousins, a throng of unknown Christian
names, every one of which it was evident had
characteristics of its own with which both the speakers
were acquainted. The listener felt as if a throng of
new acquaintances crowded softly in, filling the dim
place with not unfriendly faces.</p>

<p>"And what is Elinor doing?" Mrs. Morgan
said.</p>

<p>"It is easy to answer that question, grandmother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
She is spoiling her children, and we all know
so much better, we who have none."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; that is always the way," said the old
lady. "But, Roland, you must tell her from me
that it is very foolish. She will not think it is
ignorance on my part. Her mother, poor dear,
was just the same," and here the old lady shook
her head softly, with a glitter in her eyes, as if a
tear was not far off; but if so, there was sweetness
in the tear. She turned, after a time, to Hester,
who sat by, with a strange sort of pleasure to which
she was unaccustomed, listening, in surprised interest,
without wishing to take any part.</p>

<p>"You are surprised to hear me so talkative,
Hester? But it is not often I have a grandson to
wake me up. You did not know I had one
perhaps? Ah! I have been hearing of so many
people that I don't often hear of. That does an
old body good."</p>

<p>"I like it too," said Hester, the firelight adding
colour and animation to her face. "I did not
know there were so many people in the world."</p>

<p>"That's very pretty of you to say, my dear,"
said the old lady. "I was afraid you would think
it all gossip; but they are people who belong to
me, the most of them. And letters don't tell you
like the voice. You must run away when you are
tired, for I think I shall go on asking questions
till midnight. This young lady&mdash;this dear girl&mdash;Roland,
is the comfort of our lives."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought no less," said the voice of the shadow,
with a softness which went to Hester's heart, sending
a little thrill of pleasure through her. She had
not even seen his face&mdash;but she could not be unaware
that he was looking at hers&mdash;from the protecting
darkness on the other side of the fire. This curious
pleasurable encounter, as through a veil, of two fresh
souls, hitherto unknown to each other&mdash;a moment as
full of enchantment as can be in this world&mdash;was
suddenly broken in upon by the old captain, who
jumped up, notwithstanding his rheumatism, as
quickly as a boy, and, coming between, stood up
with his back to the fire, interrupting the light.</p>

<p>"My old woman," he said, "your Elinors and your
Emilys are like a book to her. It is like reading a
chapter at hazard out of a novel; but there is no end
to the story and no beginning, and she is at this
moment deep in her own&mdash;approaching the end of the
third volume."</p>

<p>"I should have said, to see Miss Vernon," said
the stranger, who was more a voice than ever,
now that the old man interrupted what little light
there was, "that she was at the beginning of the
first."</p>

<p>Was it the beginning of the first? Hester felt
a wave of colour fly over her face, and thought in
her heart that the new-comer was right. The initial
chapter&mdash;surely this was true; not even a
beginning, but something that went before any
beginning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"It never answers," said Captain Morgan, "to give
an opinion without knowledge of the facts. You are
a clever fellow, Roland, but not so clever as that
comes to. You will find, Hester, that round every
human creature you come across, there is some kind
of a world hanging 'bound with gold chains about
the feet of&mdash;&mdash;' That is the most uncomfortable
metaphor I know. I wonder what Mr. Tennyson
could have been thinking of? Did he think that
this round world was hanging on like a big ball,
hampering the going of God, do you suppose? But
there is something of that kind, true enough, with
men."</p>

<p>"If you mean that for me," said the old lady,
smiling, "you are wrong, Rowley. God knows my
heart yearns after them all, great and small, and it is
the greatest refreshment and no hampering, to hear
about them all&mdash;their pleasures and their troubles.
What hurts me is to keep it all in and ask no questions,
as so often I have to do."</p>

<p>The old captain shook his head. He kept on
shaking it gently.</p>

<p>"We have argued that question a great many
times," he said, "but I am not convinced."</p>

<p>What was evident was, that he intended this conversation
which had been so animated and pleasant to
come to an end. He could not surely be unkind?
But he placed himself, as it were, in the midst of the
current, and stopped its flowing. A sensation of
vexed displeasure and disappointment with her old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
friend whom she loved rose in Hester's mind. Was
it like him to reject the kindness of kin, to limit his
wife in her affections, to turn a cold shoulder on his
grandson? And yet all these things he seemed
to do. "Roland" on the other side (she knew no
other name for him), had been silenced. He had
scarcely attempted to speak since the old man took
that place in front of the fire, from which his shadow
fell like a dark pillar across the room, dividing the
side on which Mrs. Morgan sat with Hester beside
her, from the other on which was the new being with
whom Hester had already formed an almost intimate
acquaintance she felt, though she did not know his
name and had not seen his face. This very uncertainty
pleased her imagination, and inclined her to
the new-comer. But it was embarrassing to find herself
in the midst of a scene, where so many confusing
uncomprehended elements were at work, and where
something which was not family harmony and peace
lay evidently under the surface. When she rose up
to go away, the unknown rose too; but the captain
was on the alert.</p>

<p>"You can now go back to your gossip," he said,
"my dear: for I mean to see Hester round the
corner."</p>

<p>"No, Captain Morgan. It is very damp, and your
rheumatism&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah! my rheumatism. There are worse things
than my rheumatism," he said, bustling to get his
coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Might I not replace you, grandfather? It would
be a pleasure, and I have no rheumatism."</p>

<p>This idea pleased Hester. It would be only for a
moment; but he was something new. She was so
sadly familiar with every person and thing about
that any novelty was delightful to her. But the
captain was not to be shaken off. He pushed Roland
back into his seat. "There are worse things than
rheumatism," he said. And he scrambled into his
coat and took Hester under his arm with unwonted
formality. She felt annoyed and angry beyond
description, vexed with her old friend. Why should
he interrupt the innocent talk? Why interfere so
pointedly to prevent the simplest communication
between her and the stranger? A mere politeness,
where could have been the harm of that? And
then it was quite unnecessary that anybody should
see her home. That the old man should risk an
illness to do this, when she had so often run unattended
from one door to the other, was more
irritating than words could say. And, what was
worst of all, it made the captain less perfect in her
opinion&mdash;the captain of whom she had felt that, all
the rest of the world failing her, here was still an
excellence upon which she could fall back.</p>

<p>Since they had come in, though the interval was
short, the autumn evening had closed in completely. It
was very damp and cold. The Common lay in a white
mist; the sky hazy, with a few faint stars looking
down through veils of vapour; the atmosphere heavy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should you come out to catch cold?" Hester
said. "I want no one. I am quite able to take
care of myself."</p>

<p>"And I want no one, my dear, except myself, to
have anything to do with you," said the old man.
"I am not afraid to tell you my meaning, without
disguise."</p>

<p>"Then stand at the door while I run home," she
pleaded; but he would not spare her a step of the
way. He hobbled along to the verandah, with his
comforter twisted about his throat and mouth,
speaking out of the folds of it with a muffled voice.</p>

<p>"If it was any girl but you I should be afraid to
say it, lest the mere contradiction might be enough
for them; but with you I am not afraid," he said.</p>

<p>Was his confidence justified? Was Hester too
wise to be moved by that hint of opposition, that
sense that a thing which is forbidden must be
pleasant? It is dangerous to predict of any one
that this will be the case; and perhaps the captain
did his best to falsify his own hope. He took her to
the very door and saw her admitted, as if there
might be a chance up to the last moment of the
alarming grandson still producing himself to work
her harm. And then he hobbled back in the gathering
mists. He even stood lingering at his own
door before he went in to the fireside and the
cheerful light.</p>

<p>"Neither Catherine nor Hester, neither the young
nor the old," he said to himself. In his earnestness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
he repeated the words half aloud, "Neither Catherine
nor Hester, neither money nor love." And then
there came something of scorn into the old man's
voice. "If his father's son is capable of love,"
he said.</p>
